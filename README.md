Next word prediction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is a common application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in natural language processing. LSTMs are well-suited for sequential data because they can retain information over long sequences, which is important for tasks like language modeling and next word prediction.

In this task, an LSTM model is trained on a large corpus of text to learn the patterns and structures of language. The model takes a sequence of words as input and predicts the most likely next word in the sequence. The key advantage of LSTMs over standard RNNs is their ability to maintain long-term dependencies, which helps improve the accuracy of predictions, especially when dealing with longer sentences or contexts.

## The process typically involves:

### Data Preprocessing: The text is tokenized and converted into sequences of words or characters.

### Training: The LSTM model is trained on these sequences to learn the probability distribution of the next word given a sequence of words.

### Prediction: Once trained, the model can predict the next word by providing a sequence of words as input and selecting the word with the highest predicted probability.

### This approach can be used for various applications, such as autocompletion, text generation, and conversational agents.
