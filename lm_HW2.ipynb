To understand the text generation process with a language model, consider it as an iterative approach. Initially, we predict the first word from the input sequence and subsequently use that predicted word in the input to generate the second word. Repeat the process until done.  \n","\n","If we recall, we focused on letter generation in class. Now, using the review data in HW1, let's build upon the in-class examples to create a simulated review using a GRU or LSTM model. For simplicity's sake, let's concentrate on coding the training process without delving into hyperparameter tuning or model evaluations. We'll generate both a negative review (combining 1-star, 2-star, and 3-star comments) and a positive review (utilizing 4-star and 5-star comments). Essentially, our goal is to generate tokens instead of individual letters."],"metadata":{"id":"0P3dYnt6qAHf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# import google drive\n","\n","from google.colab import
