I finally decided on this one. Big mistake. The KRUPS F203 does, indeed, grind coffee beans. But trying to transfer the grounds to oneâ??s coffee maker results in a huge mess. (I wouldnâ??t know but perhaps this highly rated grinder would be appropriate for grinding spices. But itâ??s way too messy for daily grinding of coffee beans.)

Recommendation: against all reviews, do not buy.', ' This makes a huge mess! Coffee grinds everywhere. Need a brush to get them out.

DO NOT BUY', ' After a couple of months doesn\\\\t grid beans well. Big pieces in grids.', ' Bad!', ' I had the same problem that others on Amazon are having with this product (who likely left bad reviews as I\\\\m doing here right now). I just purchased this same filter from Walmart recently along with a brand new Brita water pitcher (yes both the filter and pitcher are new and compatible with each other...and the filter that came with the pitcher had the same issue as well). I thought I was crazy as to why quite a bit of the dirty water was leaking through the filter around the edges of where the filter sits flush with the pitcher housing; and watching the \\\\dirty\\\\ water drip around the actual filter and into the clean water reservoir I just cringed and scratched my head... After triple checking and making sure the filter was properly rotated so that it inserted into the unit all the way properly, I pushed so darn hard that I was ready for the unit to break, the filter looked flush with the water pitcher housing...and alas, water still leaks through and the filter clearly does NOT seal well with this unit. I find it almost humorous that I only came here to read these Amazon reviews describing the same exact issues after I decided to Google my problem and see if there was a magic solution, and I see Brita repeatedly replying with we\\\\re sorry! call our customer service and we will help!...or you need to insert the filter properly by lining it up and firmly pressing down. If you go onto Brita\\\\s website and look up their advanced water filters for sale and check out the customer reviews there, you will ALSO find more dissapointed customers complaining about the water filters not properly sealing and allowing dirty water to pass through...along with the same sad responses from Brita support which seemingly makes Brita look like they\\\\re being proactive. Unfortunately as in this case, sometime\\\\s replying with the same canned responses that don\\\\t really solve the problem is just as bad as no customer service or reply as well; clearly Brita is in denial or won\\\\t publicly accept fault for this issue. I think the worst part in all of this though, is that there are likely many consumers who get their new Brita and set it up and are excited or just used to the way their old Brita filters worked, and they don\\\\t even bother to look carefully and see whether or not any dirty water is getting through the filter because it doesn\\\\t seal properly/completely in a water-tight fashion within the water pitcher apparatus. So all of the great things Brita says about it keeping you and your family safe by filtering your water is somewhat misleading with product defects like this. You\\\\re buying a filter to clean your water, you don\\\\t even notice its NOT cleaning your water, and you go on happily and ignorantly drinking your slightly-less-dirty water that still has some contaminants in it because the filter doesn\\\\t seal well. The essential function function of a water filter like this is to filter ALL of the water, not just most of it...if the product can\\\\t filter 99.99999% of the water being poured into it, then it is most certainly a defective product. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Brita that they aren\\\\t purposely and knowingly selling a defective filter-design, it\\\\s still pretty apparent that they have a pretty high number of manufacturing defects going on where the plastic isn\\\\t lining up and providing a perfect seal between the water pitchers and advanced water filters. FYI, Brita Customer Service, if you respond to my message with anything less than something like you are correct, we apologize for selling a flawed product for some time now as evidenced by countless negative reviews, and we are in the works to create a new and better design that keeps the water filter tightly, properly, and easily sealed when inserted...then I know you haven\\\\t read or care about what I say or anyone else has been complaining about regarding this issue. No need for me to call Brita customer service either, I\\\\m going to buy a filter now from your competitor and I can only hope it works the way it should. Thanks for reading and please escalate this complaint to your CEO and COO and any other concerned parties who will actually take notice of this and resolve the problem without pushing it under the carpet.', ' I have a water tester and my water tested with as many or more particles after using the filter.

The price is fair compared to many other products (one I use costs $15 dollars but comes with satisfaction guaranteed or money back) where as this i\\\\m stuck with it unless I went to a salon and buy it. Has a dull shine to it so hair looks more natural and didn\\\\t cause much greasiness later on. I have dark brown hair that has a lot of texture to it, I\\\\m also Native American so this product has a lot of flakiness on my end and i\\\\m not sure if that\\\\s natural or it\\\\s just my hair genetics not agreeing with the product.

Not sure if this represented valid reasoning on my part, but the fact is, this item failed almost immediately. For some reason, the designers thought it would be better to have small, individual plastic scraping surfaces on the working end rather than a single, stout blade. As such, these little fingers started breaking off almost immediately and I ended up just throwing the scraper away after a frustrating first use.

The chord that plugs into your phone or MP3 player malfunctioned and I needed to jiggle it for it to work; until it just stopped working altogether. The Monster adapter had louder operating noise, and obviously isn\\\\t working so the quality was sub-par, but the sound quality was awesome. Sounded like a direct connection through an MP3 port; except for the operation chatter. I have an Infiniti with BOSE audio, so the audio system in the car is great. I now use the RCA adapter for my wife\\\\s Chrysler, which has a lesser quality stereo and it still sounds just ok, but allows you to use Pandora or Spotify if you do not have a direct port.

After reading all the reviews, I thought that this was the best that we could do. However, within 20 minutes of installing it in my car, we smelled smoke and ran down to see this device on fire. The sound insulation under the hood consequently caught on fire, and burned through the hood, and bits of burning insulation fell into the engine block. This was one of the most frightening things we\\\\ve every experienced, and we were in complete shock and had to put the fire out ourselves. Had we left this unattended and left the house, our entire house would have been up in smoke, particularly because our carport is under the house. The manufacturer passed us onto his insurer, who is stalling on paying our repair costs, saying that it was user error. Use this device at your own risk! I am reporting this device to the local and Federal consumer protection agencies, and am fighting the insurance company to get the body damage on my car repaired. Take a look of the photos I\\\\ve attached, and you can see the positive connection completely blackened and melted, and the damage it did to my hood.', ' I\\\\ve owned BatteryMINDer chargers for years with very good experiences. I bought this BatteryTender Jr. on impulse as a Lightning Deal. It was so useless at charging my car batteries I was convinced that it was defective. I repeatedly had the experience were I put it on fully charged battery only to have the batery BE DEAD the next day! It worked as a battery DIScharger! I think the 0.75 amps capacity of the Jr is not enough to even maintain the battery charged while mounted in the car, much less charge it. I put larger Genius and BatteryMINDer chargers on those cars where the Jr failed and they are now topped off.

The other set seems to be made pretty well, but these from Black Mountain are higher quality. The nylon webbing and hardware are heavier and have an overall better quality look. I\\\\ve been using resistance bands for years. Not as my sole resistance routine, but to suppliment my exercise machines and free weights. Everyone that exercises should give bands a try if they haven\\\\t as they are very effective. As these eventually wear out as they all do in time, I\\\\ll replace them with Black Mountain products again. My only complaint is there is a slip of paper that came with the bands offering me a free orange band, but the phone number given doesn\\\\t seem to connect to anything.', ' My husband uses these and finds them to be good for his arthritis stretching exercises', ' I got these for Christmas and have been using them multiple days a week since. The resistance is great. I would agree that the low resistance is pretty worthless but maybe some use it?? I was a little skeptical about the customer service given the review but I called to inquire about these before purchase and they answered right away which gave me a little more confidence. So far so good, I will let you know if there are any issues with the bands themselves after continue usage between 3-4x/wk.', ' Haven\\\\t had it long enough to use all of the components but so far I\\\\m impressed with the quality of the material. I also really like the fact that you can remove and mix/match the bands using the hooks on each end. All in all, so far so good, and they do what they\\\\re meant to do. Will update once I can try the other exercise positions using the door anchor.', ' I\\\\m not a weight guy and I\\\\ve tried resistance bands in the past and was never that impressed. This product is great. It doesn\\\\t have that flimsy, cheap feel. It feels solid and offers good resistance and is easy to use. I\\\\ve used it now for a while and I will keep on using it instead of throwing it in some drawer to gather dust. I would highly recommend this product for both beginners and veterans. And it is compact enough to take with me on trips', ' I love this product! Upon first receiving it I was skeptical that these would provide a good workout but I can assure you after doing a little 10 minute workout found on YouTube, these little bands deliver! I was so sore after just a short workout. I highly recommend this product to anyone considering a home exercise product to keep themselves fit.', ' Excellent packaging. The whole set fits neatly into the carrying bag. Excellent for travel. The bands appear to be of superior quality when compared to SPRI. Connecters work well, as does the door mount. Stacking the bands is easy, and quality control has ensured that the bands are of consistent length. Awesome purchase.', ' Received these as a gift. Construction seems pretty legit. I like the Carabiners vice plastic clips of competitors. The handles and other attachment points feel quality. Perfect to stay on track while traveling and can\\\\t take the weights with me. Would recommend this product and company to friends and family.', ' Alot of bang ð??¥ for the buck. Effective work out without the hassles of changing weight and buying expensive equipment. Best of all you can take it with you when traveling. It comes with a carrying case and has an instruction manual which clearly shows the different exercises and how to set up what is needed.', ' Good for a light workout. It is very portable, gives you more variety of exercises you can do and takes up much less space then a set of dumbells. The bands are sturdy and the connections at the end are solid and seem well made. Overall a very good value as long as you aren\\\\t looking for real heavy lifting.', ' I purchased these bands to help re-strengthen after shoulder surgery, and have been very happy with them. Quality is excellent. It\\\\s fast and easy to change the handles from one band to another, and the carry-bag has made it easy to take these with me wherever I might travel. Highly recommended.', ' these were perfect for my home gym. Easier to store and move than dumbbells, and significantly cheaper. The handles and door frame loop are advantages over traditional bands and make them feel more like gym machines than exercise bands.', ' Great product , I don\\\\t have time to go to the gym and this product is very good because I can take it anywhere. I just started using it with my P90X and it works very well.

We have a ranch house on the side of a mountain and it gets very cold. Combine that with really crummy old windows and our house was freezing. Not good when you pay for home heating oil!!! It was so bad at one point that when it was windy outside, I actually witnessed the drapes in my house billowing into the room. That is when I decided to purchase this kit. I actually got 2 kits to make sure I could finish all the windows in my house, and I ended up having plenty left over. I installed the double sided tape and stuck on the plastic, used the blowdryer to warm it up and shrink wrap the windows, and I was done. No more draft or chilly rooms! You are supposed to take it off after each winter but I have left it on for 2 years now. I find it also keeps my house cooler in the summer. Combined with thermal drapes, you have a combination for energy savings. PROS: - sticks great and lasts for a long time -once you get the hang of it, its easy to install -really has saved us money on home heating oil CONS: - if you don\\\\t totally shrink the plastic, you can see the ripples from the outside of the house and it looks a little messy, but if you do it right it is crystal clear -it is awfully hard to get the double stick tape off if you leave the product up for a long time We are now going into our third winter with the same kit on our windows and we are only now noticing some of the windows are losing their plastic in some places, peeling etc. But thats to be expected when its only supposed to be left on for a shorter period of time.', ' My apartment has a front living room with three windows that let in very cold air in winter, so I moved my living room into the middle dining room. I keep the door between the two rooms open enough for my cats to get through. I rarely go in the front room in winter because it\\\\s so cold. My friend helped me install this insulator, which turned out to be very easy. Just apply the double-sided tape around the frame, attach the plastic, and then blow dry with heat to tighten the plastic. I can barely even see the insulating plastic. The only problem is that I had to decide if I wanted the window blinds up or down, because the plastic covers the entire window casing. You will not be able to use your blinds or shades, just drapery. I\\\\ve lived here in Erie, PA, seven years, and I\\\\ve wasted so much money on gas. When I moved from the front room to the middle room and kept the door between the two ajar instead of wide open, I reduced my monthly gas budget from $98 to $72. Now that I have this product, my monthly amount is $42! Unbelievable!', ' This is a great product to prevent leaky windows from succeeding in letting cold air inside. The tape holds well when the outdoor wind blows. PLEASE READ: Exercise patience, measure TWICE before you cut the film and allow for an extra inch, don\\\\t skimp or you will regret it (read: trying to pull too tight when mounting and risk not fitting or tear of film). Glad I bought one extra box to learn from mistakes and not have to wait /endure more cold. I like that visibility outside is not compromised', ' I love this product, we have an old house and a lot of leaks around the windows. This significantly changes the room temperature, it increased the warmth of the room significantly. It took us one window to figure out the technique for putting it into place and once we got the technique down it was very easy to put in place. Use the hair dryer at the end to tighten up the material and you are good to go. Will be using this for every winter from here on out for the cold Chicago winters.', ' Great product, seals great and definitely makes a huge difference in temperature. My heat kicks on less often. Depending on window size, you can sometimes get more than 3 windows out of it! Most important step not to skip is making sure your window sill is CLEAN. If it\\\\s not, the insulator tape is not going to stick, and cold air will seep in.', ' My brother installed these for me. He used a hot blower gun (sort of like a hair dryer) and it shrunk it so that I cannot even tell that there is plastic over my windows! Seriously, they are invisible. I can tell already that it will keep my daylight basement warmer :). I highly recommend this!', ' Such a simple solution, and it really works. Older home, not able to afford fancy new windows. I immediately put this on my worst problem window and it\\\\s made a big difference.', ' Helped keep the room much warmer. My girlfriends room is above the garage so we insulated the windows to cut down on the cold air getting in. It definitely helped.', ' Super easy to use- never needed to use a window insulating kit before but was pleasantly surprised at how much it helped the draft coming from my windows.', ' Reallt easy to use. Great to cover the windows to keep out the cold air. This comes w double sided tape to help gmÄ£ <', ' Do be careful using pressure to smooth the film when sticking it.

There is a bit of a learning curve to get them to lay flat, but that\\\\s life kids. I\\\\ve been using them for the past 2 years and I live in Chicago. I can\\\\t verify (due to changing weather temps) if I\\\\ve saved money on my heating bill, but I\\\\d like to think so. It\\\\s well worth the price of them and I DEFINITELY notice the drafts stopped. The windows are always icing up ,from condensation, once it gets below 32º. I\\\\ve tried ceiling fans to keep the air flowing, but to no avail. These window films do the trick every time. No more icing up. No more water from condensation on my window sills. No more mold growth from the moisture. Buy them, put them up and stay warm all season.', ' Easy to use...', ' Worked great', ' There are not 5 different sheet of material for 5 windows, rather there is one large sheet that you have to cut into 5 pieces to make it work for 5 windows. Otherwise it\\\\s a fine product.', ' It did a perfect job of keeping the cold air out around our A/C so that we did not have the hassle of removal and storage.', ' This is the first time I used 3M window insulation and istallation was a breeze. The scotch tape held like a champ and the plastic is so clear that if you give it good heat from the hair dryer it almost feels like there is nothing in front of window.

On March 17th, 2012, my next door neighbor was outside his house and VERY FOOLISHLY poured gasoline from a full 2.5-gallon container onto a pile of hot smoldering wooden logs. Of course the can exploded and it landed against the outside of his 2-story house. The house is wood frame house with painted wood siding. At this point he was on fire, so he rolled on the ground to put himself out. He ended up with 3rd degree burns, but his next action was to get up and come find me.

Watching the tea spread from it is lovely. Makes having tea a little bit nicer', ' I couldn\\\\t live without this tool in my kitchen. I am zesting and grating regularly and having a Microplane in easy reach is an essential. I have several styles of Microplanes (for grating different things and different sizes) but this is the one I use the most for limes, lemons, oranges, etc. Fits right in the dishwasher when I am done and is always sharp and useful. This was a replacement for one that I had had for many years and it had finally gotten a little dull. But after ten years of essentially daily use, I guess it was allowed to be not so sharp.', ' Microplane is a great grater. We bought this planer on the advice of our daughter whose kitchen philosophy is have a few gadgets but make them high quality. This grater planer works very well. I typically use it to zest lemons or to grate Parmesan cheese. It does both jobs perfectly and is easy to clean. NowI buy cheese in a block which is better, cheaper and keeps longer.', ' So this has become one of my favorite kitchen tools. I use it to easily grate down garlic into a fine consistency that almost melts into soups and sauces. It\\\\s also perfect for getting the zest off of lemons or oranges. It\\\\s a delightfully versatile tool that is absolutely worth it.', ' This microplane is fantastic and I use it every day!! Great for mincing garlic, zesting lemons or limes, grating cheese, etc. Have bought additional ones for friends and family - great buy.', ' A must have , if you need a zester. So easy to use and makes fast work of citrus peel. You can quickly add citrus zest and clean up is so easy. Storage of this slim item is easy too.', ' Love these. I purchased one for myself a while back and loved it so much, I got one for each of my daughters. It\\\\s reasonably priced and the quality is very nice as well.', ' We\\\\ve had this for two years. So many other microplaners fell apart but this one is great and we use it all the time. I only wish it were slightly easier to clean.', ' I love this Microplane. We use it mostly for citrus zest and parmasen cheeses on our pastas. Its dishwasher safe. It can be sharp though so be careful.', ' The first few times I used it I ended up with a little bit too much finger in my finger food, if you know what I mean. Watch yourself.', ' Love this Zester!

Krups adds a flat side to the cap interior so it does this and grinds well but Krups makes the cap from a cheap brittle plastic that spontaneously cracks from normal use. I patched the first crack but others kept coming -- there are already five after three months of use -- and this means that cap will sooner rather than later break apart. (See photo) Amazon\\\\s price was $19.99 but I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon that brought the price to $15.00.', ' Pros: Cheap, powerful motor and blades Cons: Uneven grind, smallish capacity If you\\\\re looking for a coffee grinder, I wouldn\\\\t recommend a bladed one, especially if you care about using the right size grind for the right drink. Blade grinders are cheap, but a burr grinder ensures a uniform grind, which is important to get a consistent flavor and brew. This grinder, however, would be perfect for spices, and I would actually recommend using it only for that. Cleaning is relatively easy: just use a damp paper towel to wipe up the remains and a dry one to finish the job.', ' This thing can grind! It has ground up everything I have placed in it with ease! Now the bad stuff. The unit is really really hard to clean. The only way to keep it clean is to wash it after every use. I use it to grind up foods I have dehydrated. It has powdered up sweet peppers, carrots, kale, beets, lime, ginger, and turbinado sugar. So after each use I had to clean it up. It was a big chore due to not having any napkins! I bought a brush to clean it but it isn\\\\t the best thing and you will need to put some water in it to get the dust out from the bottom of the blade. The unit does seem to be waterproof but I am not trying to find out. It did shoot water out from the lid so I learned really fast to only place a small amount in there at a time as to allow the particles stuck under the blade to remove themselves. The unit itself is surprisingly heavy. After a few uses it stopped working but with a few shakes it would turn on. I believe it stopped working due to the lid not being down all the way. I want to process coffee beans at least once to see the end results but from my experience I don\\\\t know how anyone could get anything but a fine grind. It seems to powder everything in seconds. In seconds you can see powder forming on the lid. I have no idea how I would get a coarse grind with the KRUPS. Maybe the result is different with coffee beans than with dehydrated food. I imagine I would have to pulse it for no longer than a second. This is exactly what I was looking for though in the end so I give it 5 stars.', ' Replaced a really old grinder of similar type by Cusinart, This one works great and I like it since it has a larger capacity for beans so I can grind more at once. Of course the grind depends on how long you hold the button down. I like mine ground fine for an espresso machine. Some powder tends to cake under the blades. I have developed a habit of holding it up when I push the button and tilt it sideways back and forth during grinding to facilitate mixing. One would do well to count the seconds for the grind you like so to be more consistent over time. I believe it takes about 10 seconds to get to a fine enough grind. After done I put the gound coffee into a small can making a day or two\\\\s worth at one time so it is always fresh. One needs to use their finger or another object to get the caked product out of the bottom but it is not a big deal. It is easy to clean with a paper towel around the inside tapping the remainder out. I found a small brush which I use to get grind out of the crevasses. Overall I find it is a great value and works well for small portions.', ' I buy and use whole spices from a health food store. It is fresher and cheaper than packaged spices on the grocery shelves. It allows me the flexibility to purchase exact amounts for a particular recipe without wasting the unused portions. Instead of buying individual spice mills I wanted one mill that could do all types of grinding, coarse or fine. I went to America\\\\s Tedt Kitchen website to read their reviews. This product was 5 star rated. Knowing I could trust their experience and review I purchased the mill. It livesup to its claim! It has a removable cup for easy pouring and cleaning. It\\\\s the only spice mill I need. And yes, it does awesome with coffee beans, nuts, etc. I highly recommend this product! It is easy, quick, and produces an even grind.', ' This is my first ever coffee grinder and I chose this one because of the low cost and the compact design. It has been fantastic addition to our kitchen. We have fresh ground coffee every day, so delicious! It is incredibly easy to use, not too noisy and so compact, I can tuck it away in the corner and it takes up no space. My only complaint is that it is fairly easy to spill some on the counter when opening the top after you\\\\re done grinding. I\\\\m not sure if this is a universal problem with grinders or the design of this one. I just try to be extra careful to minimize spillage. So happy I chose this grinder.', ' When you are looking for a grinder you do not realize how important they are until you get this one. Then you grind your first cup of beans, and OMG. This little machine is unbeatable. It is like the ferrari of Grinders. 5 seconds and you have a perfect ground blend ready to make your day start off with a Bang. I used some in the military that actually stunk, they were slow, got stuck, not this one. This one takes a mundane task and makes it extra ordinary. I will use a Krups for the rest of my life no doubt about it.', ' Grinding cup is not removable, and product is difficult to clean. . I have to turn the grinder upside down and tap with a spoon to get the ground coffee out of the grind chamber, and there is a reside of coffee left on the lid as well as the chamber. You cannot adjust the grind and the top can be difficult to remove at times. I have to use a damp paper towel to clean the unit every time I use it which is a pain.', ' Pros: +Easy to use +Compact design +Reasonably priced Cons: -This should only be used for grinding spices. I do not suggest using this for coffee. You will NOT get a consistent texture/grain size. Buy a burr grinder for your coffee beans instead. -Difficult to clean the blade fully (especially underneath the blade). You\\\\ll have to use a pipe cleaner or a thin piece of fabric.', ' I have had this on my wish list for a while and got this for Christmas from my Father-n-Law. We both love coffee and love the strange brews from all over the world. I have a different coffee maker than he does so this will come in great use when I give him coffee. I ground my first batch already. I didnt grind the whole bag because that will ruin the flavr of the bean.', ' Bought this one to replace an earlier model that I\\\\d been using since 1978. The earlier model still worked well, but it looked awful after years of use and some accidents. I expect this model will last as long ... it certainly does the job well. I detect no loss of quality from the earlier model. I use mine for grinding spices, and just occasionally for grinding coffee beans.', ' This is great! I bought 3 bags of whole bean coffee online by mistake and didn\\\\t want to return them so I bought this grinder. It\\\\s fast, easy to use, and the cleanup is simple. I don\\\\t know how long this sort of appliance usually lasts but regardless, it\\\\s cheap enough that I wouldn\\\\t mind replacing it after a few years. Wonderful buy!', ' This works well for small quantities. It actually grinds finer than my more expensive grinder, which has several settings. That said, this grinds finely so if you need a coaster grind, this may not be ideal. It arrived in proper packaging and has been in use for nearly a year and still performs wonderfully.', ' This is a pretty good coffee grinder, but coffee tends to pack around the edges of the inside, requiring a utensil to scrape the coffee out. Also, if you\\\\re doing a fine grind, it\\\\s sometimes hard to get very fine unless you fill it at least 2/3. But generally works well, and no problems with the motor.', ' Strong little grinder and works as you would expect. The issues are with the actual lid. To get the food/coffee from the top you will ned to turn the whole thing upside dow and pat the machine to get it all out without a huge mess. Not a big deal but that great of a design', ' I bought this for grinding dried peppers for jerky and curry making. The grinder works great and you\\\\ll get very fine powder, be careful though as the dust can get in the air quite easily and like me you\\\\ll be end up with a runny nose, sneezing for 15 minutes or so, oops.', ' Love this spice grinder! It works on everything, literally. Plus, when I have to grind coffee beans occasionally for relatives, the smell doesn\\\\t linger inside afterward as long as I clean it well with a wet cloth. No complaints!', ' This grinder works very well with the regular filter coffee makers. I found the grounds were too small for my reusable k-cup. Which may just mean a new k-cup would do the trick. However, the quality of this product is great.', ' Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he just loves it! It\\\\s incredibly easy to use (one button operation!) Easy to clean as well. Plus it makes the kitchen smell great while it\\\\s grinding coffee beans :)', ' Small and powerful. Not much else to be said here. I just wish it did a better job of uniformly grinding the beans. Other than that, this thing works flawlessly. A little messy but it\\\\s coffee. Whadyagonado?', ' So far so good. I initially bought a hand grinder - ceramic type to keep the coffee as pure as possible.., but I found that it was taking WAY too long to grind. This is a good, fast solution.', ' This is a nice, simple little grinder. You can\\\\t grind huge batches of coffee at a time, but that\\\\s fine for us. I haven\\\\t used it for spices, yet, but I\\\\m sure it will work great when I do.', ' This product is excellent. Its inexpensive and made with quality. Its a great coffee grinder. There are no fancy settings. You control the type of grind manually. But its very easy use.', ' I purchased this to replace a coffee grinder that I previously had for 10 years. I have used this for coffee and spices. Works great. Runs smoothly and quietly.', ' Excellent tool. We had it for over a year with no problems. Does a good job grinding coffee does not heat the grounds too much and keeps the oils and flavores in.', ' I bought this for my son and he loves it. It grinds the coffee beans perfectly and fast. He really likes the fact this grinder also grinds spices too!', ' Nice fine grounds does a great job. These units usually don\\\\t last more than a year, time will tell if this holds true for this unit.', ' We own two of these. One for spices and one for coffee. They work great and are super easy to clean (we just use a little bit of dried rice).', ' My first time ever using this or grinding coffee. So easy! Coffee is so much better and fresher! I love this size because it\\\\s only for me.', ' Grinds well, quiet but the lid leaves a little to be desired. It is long and fits inside causing beans and grounds to cling to the sides.', ' I love this product. It\\\\s small so it\\\\s easy to store, it\\\\s quick and efficient and not very loud. And I got it for a great price.', ' I use this to pulverize my dehydrated hot peppers from my garden. Grinds them into the finest dust. Just what I needed.', ' I just needed to grind my own coffee as I am becoming a coffee snob. This seems to do well but I am just learning so....', ' I use it every morning. Works great! I put 8 Tbsp of coffee beans in it. Takes about 10s to turn them into a fine powder.', ' Since I bought it, I have used it almost everyday. The only problem is that the coffee ground sticks to the container.', ' Does the job perfectly. Nice shape for pouring directly into coffee maker once chopped. Great price, recommend highly.', ' Great grinder for coffee. Durable. Replaces our old Braun grinder.Simple one function grind, no bells or whistles.', ' This was my first attempt at grinding. I was not impressed. Functioned sufficiently, but not as fine as I\\\\d hoped.', ' Basic coffee grinder, not very loud, grinds beans perfectly, use daily, clean with a small unused makeup brush.', ' Just purchased and I really like it so far.

LOVE IT!!', ' this is a Christmas present to someone...so do not have like or dislike yet.', ' It works well but the container is too small for us. End up returning it.', ' I bought my brita pitcher years ago, and the filters looked different when I first bought it so I was nerves that my pitcher was too old and it would not fit. But, it was no problem since these filters fit perfectly. The top of these filters look different. It has a thinner top. I love it because it is easier to grab and take out of the pitcher. The old filters I had to struggle with to get out. Sometimes I had to disassemble to top of the pitcher and push the filter from underneath. These new filters seem to get rid of that problem! Also, there is barely any pre-soaking required! I got these out of the package expecting to soak them in a bowl for several hours, but the instructions said to just rinse it for a few seconds. So no more having to get a bowl out for filter replacements! The quality of the water is good too; I donâ??t notice any difference in the quality of water from the old filters. The price is reasonable. I got a five pack for $24.56. This comes out to under 13 cents per gallon if I use the recommended 40 gallons per filter.', ' I use these filters in my Brita pitcher to transfer the filtered water into my 5 gallon jug that sits on the cooler. I refuse to spend $12 for 5 gallons of spring water I have no idea if it really is spring water. I let my water sit open for 24 hours or more prior to filtering so the chlorine can vaporize and leave the water. This allows the filters to last longer.', ' Tried the cheaper, Non-Brita filters and they just aren\\\\t as good unfortunately. These new Brita filters also do not require a 15 minute soak in water,. you instead just run cold water over the water filter now for 15 seconds and it is ready to go. Also, there are so far a lot less black flecks in the top of the Brita canister and the water tastes great. Overall, to save a $1.50-2 (ish) dollars, the off-brand filters are just not worth it, my guess is they do not contain as much activated charcoal, I base this on my vast knowledge of water filter technology and science background that comes with being a communications major, so basically, nothing, but the filter is great.', ' I do not buy bottled water! I drink tap water---sometimes funny tasting tap water---hold yer nose Sulfur water that I\\\\m told is good for me. Um. But! Two years ago I was gifted with a Brita Pitcher. It really makes a difference. I soon needed replacement filters because I followed manufacturer\\\\s instructions. DON\\\\T FOLLOW MANUFACTURE\\\\S INSTRUCTIONS! I\\\\ve found that I can use Brita filters for many months and the water quality is crystal clear and without any unpleasant taste. I only replace filters when the filter gets clogged up.', ' I started using the Brita water Pitcher over 5 years ago. I always complained about how hard it was to remove the filter from the pitcher, until now. Thank jesus for R&D. Now they made so it\\\\s very easy to get out and you do not have to soak it in a glass of water anymore. These filter works great and you can really tell the difference when drinking water. No chlorine taste and no charcoal flakes floating around in the water. Good price great product. I only gave it 4 stars because 5 stars are meant for angels and gods.', ' Works like it should. Water tastes great filtered with this.', ' a great price for all three', ' good price', ' For perfectly in the Brita slim 5 cup pitcher', ' Yeah, this is a Brita review, because why? Because these little boxes of charcoal make my disgusting, dirty hot tub smelling municipal chlorine and flouride bath straight from the sewer tap water taste like I\\\\m drinking straight form the freshest mountain stream. These things work wonders!', ' Works well, it did come loose in the pitcher once and carbon dust came out and settled at the bottom. After repositioning the filter and cleaning the bottom of the pitcher, there was no more carbon dust.', ' I love these. They are more people expensive at the store so better to by then on Amazon. I did not give them a 5 star because. I can\\\\t tell what is actually filtered out only a lab could.', ' Been buying these replacement filters for years. Great price with this bulk purchase. Really makes my water taste delightful. Also use filtered water in coffee maker and iron.', ' Switched to Pur because these filters went bad so quickly. Now the Pur filters take forever to filter, but still better than Brita. In my opinion.', ' I got these and ended up splitting them with a friend. Great option instead of getting them from the store. So much cheaper.', ' Brita filters are good in general but do not filter deposits. I sometimes see small particles of debris or sand.', ' Don\\\\t have to soak it like the old ones. No more black specks in the fill tank. I like the improvements.', ' We live our brita pitcher. The 3 pack was a good deal. We\\\\ll be stocked for a few months now.', ' These newer style of filter general release less carbon (black sediment) in the water.', ' It claims to remove the heavy metals, except I do not see lead on their list.', ' Great - keep the pitcher filled to fill my Keurig coffee pot', ' Very pleased with my purchase.

Either way, I replace these after a few months of use.', ' works wells', ' Well, it\\\\s a water filter. Not much to say!', ' cool stuff', ' Great product. Be careful with stirring it when you are making Carmel/sweet corn. The handle has a plastic gear on it and that can break if you twist it too hard or too fast. I love making my own popcorn with olive oil, and a little salt. You don\\\\t need to buy their brand of popcorn. They are great tasting but they are expensive. DO NOT buy another brand of ready to use popcorn oil and salt bags. If they are cheap, they will taste horrible. Just use regular popcorn, one tablespoon popcorn to one tablespoon olive oil. 4-5 tablespoons for 2 adults. Should be pretty close to perfect. Salt to preference. Great white elephant gift!!!!', ' Our family loves popcorn! We were buying bags upon bags of popcorn to pop as our night time snack during family time. There is no better snack on movie night in our house. That is why when I saw the Wabash Valley Farms Whirley-Pop I couldn\\\\t wait to try it! I read the mixed reviews and was cautiously optimistic. The product arrived with a 5.5 oz Wabash Valley Real Theater Popcorn all-inclusive kit... WINNING! I was super excited for the bonus popcorn to try out our Whirley-pop for the first time! We made our first batch of popcorn the night it arrived. The directions included were super easy to follow, and in 3 1/2 minutes we had perfectly popped buttery popcorn. Just like that in 3 1/2 minutes I was mom of the year! The Whirley-pop was constructed really well. All the pieces look like they will last a long time. I had read a lot of comments about the gears breaking and I don\\\\t know if the company has improved that piece but mine appear to be extremely solid and well made. I will update again after continued use.', ' I purchased the Whirley-Pop in June 2015 through Amazon, a little over 6 months ago. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it broke within 6 months and the Wabash Valley Farms replacement cost, despite its warranty, is something you might want to consider when you purchase, along with which version of the popper you\\\\d like. I learned from the folks at WVF that the gears on the version Amazon sells are plastic. I hadn\\\\t known there were two versions of this popper available from WVF, one with plastic gears and one with die cast metal gears. WVF said that Amazon opted to sell this version only but I could be upgraded to a replacement cover with the metal gears for an additional cost. Wabash Valley Farms has a 25 year warranty on its products, but it cost me an additional $16+ to upgrade to the metal-geared cover. I thought I should warn other potential customers that, given the REAL cost of a replacement that would last, they might want to purchase the version with the metal gears in the first place.', ' \\xa0The Whirley Pop is the best thing since sliced bread!! Ever since I was a little girl I have loved homemade popcorn. My grandmother would make it for us whenever we spent the night. Theater and microwave popcorn cannot hold a candle to Grandma\\\\s popcorn. A friend recently gave us a Whirley Pop popcorn popper. Oh my goodness! This thing is the bomb!! Tonight I made my second batch, and it was as perfect as the first one was. NOT ONE SINGLE UNPOPPED KERNAL! I seasoned the pot per the enclosed instructions before first use. For both batches I used 3 Tablespoons vegetable oil and one half cup Orville Redenbocker\\\\s Original Gourmet Popping Corn. Both batches turned out perfectly. I attached video to demonstrate how easy it is to use and the amount of popcorn in a single batch.', ' I had recently tried Kettle Korn and fell in love with the salty and sweet taste. I tried to recreate it at home but just burnt my pots, twice. I looked up some recipes and came across a clip of Martha Stewart making some with the Whirley-Pop. After watching the video I placed an order for it. When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a bag of popcorn with butter. I tried to make the kettle corn again and this time, it was a success. I have also made regular butter popcorn successfully. If you do kettle corn, add the sugar and salt a minute after you put all the corn kernels in, They will be a whitish color, that\\\\s the best time to add it in.', ' This popcorn popper is simple, but works so well! I received it as a gift and I won\\\\t make popcorn with anything else. I use 1/2 cup of Pop Secret popcorn and a little bit of corn oil and I get 10 cups of perfectly popped popcorn. Every time. I just made some and had just one unpopped kernel. The only downside is that you have to hand wash lid/handle, but I feel like that\\\\s a small price to pay. Love it...highly recommend!!', ' what keeps me from loving it is the material used. it feels like thin cheap metal that will damage pretty quickly, i.e. burn marks that won\\\\t clean up as well as a pain to clean on the inside. waiting to see what happens 5 uses in, but so far so good. just wish the metal was a little more sturdy or thick/firm.', ' I bought this as a surprise for my popcorn loving wife. Her words, one of the be presents ever! She is beyond pleased with the quality of the popping and taste of the popcorn. It works just the way it is described and eliminates clean up too! If you like popcorn, you will love the Whirley-Pop!', ' I bought this for my partner who had burnt up my big soup pot making popcorn. He bought me a new pot for Christmas :) This popcorn maker is awesome for folks who just don\\\\t like the taste of air popped. the handle is connected to a wire I believe he\\\\s used the thing every day since Christmas.', ' All I can say cant go wrong with a whirley pop..we had our old whirley pop for several years and had to get anouther one..if u want good popped popcorn the whirley pop is the way to go better then the electric popcorn poppers...if u buy you wont be disappointed.', ' slight pain to clean. Not it\\\\s fault really. I love popcorn. I use jiffy pop kernels or Orville Reddenbachers and a bit of peanut oil to make the popcorn. Cabot Cheddar shake from wabash valley farms seals the deal. Its like crack, you can\\\\t stop eating it.', ' Works beautifully! Saves money compared to microwave popcorn. When you use this to pop corn you get a truly healthful snack. Low in calories; no artificial color, flavor or preservatives. I had forgotten how good freshly popped popcorn is.', ' LOVE IT!!! Easy to use, easy to clean. I was a bit worried that my lack of hand strength would make it hard to crank, but not an issue in the least. Leaves very few unpops, much healthier than microwave and just as fast.', ' I love this popcorn maker! We have given up making instant popcorn and only do on the stove popcorn! It doesn\\\\t take that much longer and it tastes so much better! I definitely recommend this product!', ' Have been using one of these for several years now. Great product..works well, pops complete, and easy clean up, just wipe down. Also bought one for my parent\\\\s and brother\\\\s places for when we visit.', ' User friendly! Had to discontinue using my previous pop corn popper because of sustaining first degree burns all over my palms.

I bought it to use brewing beer, so I needed something a bit more accurate for controlling fermentation tempature. However, I\\\\ve started using it as a standard kitchen thermometer and it works great there! I would buy it again, certainly for the price, if I needed a kitchen thermometer or BBQ thermometer, but for a super accurate low temp thermometer, look elsewhere. Also, I tested it for freezer monitoring, and it will not read below 35 degree Fahrenheit. I give it 4 stars since it does work well, but not at the range I we hoping for.', ' You don\\\\t need two, but this thing works so well you should buy two anyway.', ' It has been rained on twice and still works great', ' Very reliable and accurate at a good value.', ' easy to use, simple unit', ' Works great, love alarm', ' As advertised', ' Solid roaster at a low price, will cook at 15 lb turkey (just). Because of the patterned surface on the bottom I wouldn\\\\t use this for any other kind of cooking since it could be harder to clean.

But I wanted to make sure due to a scheduled surgery, and I was being paranoid. Price is good, but these tests really weren\\\\t. I got lines on two of them. They weren\\\\t as clear as a positive would be, but I can definitely see how they would be misinterpreted as being positive, especially when, upon taking the thing apart, the second line had pink on the edges. So it doesn\\\\t look like just an indent or an evap. It looked like a positive. I almost cancelled surgery over it, but thankfully went through and a previous blood test confirmed I wasn\\\\t pregnant. Which I couldn\\\\t be anyway. Pre-surgery nerves did something to my mind. But I bet you could dip these things into plain water and get that line, and the indent line being visible even when you don\\\\t take it apart can make the test pretty confusing. In short I wouldn\\\\t recommend these at all. The windows for me weren\\\\t stark white and the viewing window was hard to see since it catches a lot of glare. I will say that I doubt a strong pink line would be an evap line, mine was very faint.', ' It gets a 5 star because it came back neg', ' work fine', ' Gave me my results, takes quiiiiite awhile for the hour glass to load up my results.

The description says, Each has its own seal-tight, blue plastic lid. Let\\\\s be clear... while the lids do sit firmly on the bowl, they ARE NOT leak proof. In fact, if the bowl is turned sideways, liquid will POUR out from under the lip of the lid. Time will tell how durable this set is, for the time being, I\\\\m disappointed in the quality of the seal.', ' I works really well in storage my food. I don\\\\t have so much time so I usually make a lot of food on Sunday and use this one to storage my food on refrigerator. These food storage also work well on microwave. Just be careful don\\\\t immediately make changes in temperature. I usually get it out of my refrigerator for about 15 minutes before I put it into microwave to reheat my food is contained in it.', ' It\\\\s pyrex... Thick glass, matching lids. My only concern is how easily the lid broke in shipment. The 7x11 lid was under the glass dish it matched with. It broke at seam. Hopefully they start packing these better, they packed glass well but forgot about lids probably assuming they\\\\d be fine. Otherwise, seem okay. Currently cooking with the dish... We shall see if it was more than just lid issue.', ' I typically purchase the standard plastic containers, but tired of the stains from spaghetti sauce and other foods. I love these containers. Thick and sturdy glass in various sizes. I originally wanted the red lids; however, the blue is really nice. Delivery was quick and the packaging was great. Lots of protection against breakage.', ' These are nice, sturdy storage pieces. They are, however, much much smaller than I had originally anticipated. I wouldn\\\\t have ordered if I had realized how small they actually are. They are Pyrex though, so they are of great quality. They are made of thick glass and have lids that fit well, giving them a nice and secure closure.', ' I love this set and use it all the time. So much better than the plastic ones and come out nicely clean in dishwasher...although do not put the lids in too. They are nicely sized with no too tiny ones you never use. Highly recommend this set for its quality and usefulness and nothing beats Pyrex.', ' Love these containers. They seal very well and haven\\\\t had a problem with any leaking liquids or the lids falling off while storing food in my backpack on the way to work. They are pretty solid and feel heavy which makes them feel expensive. I got them on a deal and it was VERY worth the money I paid.', ' This a great set for cold storage and reheating. We replaced plastic containers that were staining and did not fare well on the microwave. These glass containers store easy by nesting in themselves and the lids fit well and seal tight I recommend this product', ' Very versatile and great for everything from storage to good prep. Lids hold securely and air tight. They also stack pretty well and dont slip when on top of one another cause the lids are quite grippy. With proper care they will last forever as will most Pyrex products.', ' It\\\\s so convenient to be able to store food in the same dish it was cooked in. I love this set! These are solid glass baking dishes just as we have come to expect from Pyrex. The covers fit snugly and stack easily if needed. Nice variety of sizes for different needs.', ' Very nice storage set that keeps food fresh for a long time. Pyrex is a brand I trust as I\\\\ve dropped and clanged these dishes and they have not chipped or broke. I recieved the Pyrex 10 piece storage set at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.', ' Very nice, high quality. I use these to store all my tomato based sauces, as well as anything else that is acidic. They wash up great. There are no stains on these! Because of that, they look so much nicer than my old plastic containers ever did after one use.', ' Great and practical overall. Only downside is that while Pyrex suggests that you use place the lid on top of the container when microwaving, I\\\\ve had one instance of the lid basically imploding - now the lid is deformed and doesn\\\\t work the way it sound.', ' Variety of sizes. Use thse for everything. Didn\\\\t even bother buying bowls to go along with our plates as these were just fine. It\\\\s not as great as the old durable pyrex, but have not have broken one and thy\\\\ve been all over.', ' The range of sizes is exactly what I needed.

I\\\\ve used it to cut up cucumbers, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, and a few other things with both thick and thin blades. I haven\\\\t had a problem with smushing tomatoes. It\\\\s pretty easy to set up and use right out the box. I\\\\ve had a few issues with uneven cuts but I\\\\m pretty sure that it\\\\s my fault since I hadn\\\\t used one before. There are a couple reasons I took off one star. There\\\\s no easy way to store this without keeping it in the box and even then it\\\\s a pain to get everything to fit back in nicely. One of the pictures shows a nice way to situate everything to store but I haven\\\\t gotten that to work yet. It would be nice if it had a bigger stand or something, slicing over a cutting mat can be kind of a pain. There is some waste with the way you use the slice and holder. I got a safety glove (which I would recommend anyway) and it\\\\s reduced the waste a lot since I can hold that last piece and slide it myself.

I haven\\\\t heard anything back about it so I don\\\\t know how she likes it.', ' This pillow, while not the greatest in aesthetic quality, is great! I agonized over buying a costly pillow I wasn\\\\t sure would work but I\\\\m so glad I did. It DOES come with a slipcover, sure it\\\\s a bit flimsy but I\\\\ve already removed it to wash it and it was fine. For people who turn a lot I can see that this might be cumbersome to start but I\\\\ve adjusted easily to simply pulling my knees up and then rotating and putting them down again for an easy middle of the night turn. My favorite maternity purchase for sure and it\\\\s already been useful when I babysat my niece (7mos) as a bumper on my bed to prevent rolling so I\\\\m excite to keep using it after maternity as well.', ' Finally some relief! I bought this pillow while laying in my hospital bed for 11 days for a compression fracture of the spine due to a fall. I know that it seems that mostly pregnant women are using this pillow, and I can certainly understand why, but, it is also a wonderful alternative for people with pain. I also have fibromyalgia, bursitis of the shoulder and osteoarthritis of the hips, back and knees. Believe me, I know what pain is and now, due to this awesome pillow, I finally have some relief. I may just never want to get out of bed again!', ' Being pregnant was great. Until the end of the second trimester. I didn\\\\t even gain that much weight but the sheer size of my belly was just uncomfortable no matter what - until I laid on my left side in bed with my snoogle. My boyfriend quickly grew jealous of my pillow when I started to really rely heavily (pun intended) on it for cuddling at night instead of him. It held up to my weight and sweat (7 months pregnant in Florida in the summer) and I even took it with me to Disney world.', ' My mom has sciatica and she absolutely loves this pillow. Granted she loves all pillows but this one is unlike her regular body is better because it\\\\s nice and firm and actually gives her support. It comes with a sheet that gives you different ideas on how to use the pillow it\\\\s very versatile with many uses. I have even seen her walking around her house with it wrapped around her body like a snake. When she got it her dog got jealous of it so I think that says something.', ' My wife was really having a hard time getting comfortable at night during her pregnancy. So after a ton of research, we settled on this. We didn\\\\t want something super massive, to the point that I would essentially be sleeping on the floor. This pillow is the perfect companion for our bed. It\\\\s not to big, but yet, it hits all the comfort points. If you share a bed with someone and your bed is smaller than a queen, this probably isn\\\\t the right pillow for you.', ' The material is nice and is soft. My sister purchased this item when she was within her first trimester and she did not use it much. During maybe the middle of her second trimester is when she began to use the snoogle. She uses it at night when she goes to bed. The only down side to the Snoogle that my sister and brother-in-law can think is the pillow cover. Once you take it off it can be difficult to put back on because the opening to the pillow cover is only at one end. This means that you have to put the entire pillow cover back on from one end and pull the pillow through the cover all the way to the other end of the pillow. We thought it would be better if maybe a zipper was involved just because it would be easier to put the cover back on the pillow. Overall, it is still a very nice pillow.', ' My wife was not very impressed. It doesn\\\\t really support your back, at best it might just keep your back warm. It is nice to have the pillow between the legs, but you don\\\\t need a total body pillow for that. She didn\\\\t like that she couldn\\\\t use her regular pillow for her head when using this. It mostly just sits by the side of our bed.', ' I didn\\\\t want to cave and get a pregnancy pillow because of the price, but I am glad I did. This pillow does not completely take away back pain while sleeping, but it does make sleeping a WHOLE lot more comfortable! I use it every night and even during the day if I lay down on the floor. Highly recommend!', ' This pillow is completely worth it! I started sleeping with my snoogle when I was about 5-6 months pregnant, and found that I couldn\\\\t sleep without it! Even my husband has commented on how comfortable it is! Definitely worth it!', ' I thought I would love this but it takes up so much space it is like having a third person in bed with us. I also think I may be a little tall for it (I am 6 feet tall) so it is hard to get comfortable.', ' Around 18 weeks I was started becoming uncomfortable while sleeping, and this helped tremendously! I suggest buying the jersey cover for it, the original cover is a bit rough feeling on your skin.', ' I love this pillow. I have used it for two pregnancies and one major surgery. It\\\\s a life saver especially with last trimester. Does need the jersey cover to make it really comfortable though.', ' Very comfortable and durable. I could sleep with it by hugging the pillow as well as using it as back support (if I want to roll over).', ' All I can say is I wish I had bought this item earlier! Really helped with my sleep issues!. Great product at a great price! Thanks!', ' Absolutely love it. I\\\\m only in my first trimester and it really helps support my back.

Great buy!', ' my wife loves this pillow and unfortunately will no longer snuggle with me. it is a must for any pregnant woman', ' good pillow... a shame it is made in that shape and you cant make it straight, since it gets a little uncomfy...', ' If pregnant, or having back issues, this pillow is ideal! It is the only pillow I need during my pregnancy.', ' Almost like having a boyfriend says my wife. I think she was joking?!?!!? Anyway, she\\\\s happy.', ' My wife didn\\\\t like this product at first glance but as soon as she slept with it she was in love!', ' I love my Snoogle!! This quickly turned into a pregnancy essential for me, can\\\\t sleep without it!', ' Can\\\\t leave without this pillow. Either side of it is super comfy during sleep. Worth every penny!', ' Thing is super comfy.

I did confuse Joseph with one of the wisemen for a short period of time. Look for the one not holding anything. The noise is not to loud, and it doesn\\\\t last long which is helpful. Any of the pieces fit on top which makes it even more fun for the children. It is very simple to assemble also. I got this for my niece and she loved it. Played with it for quite some time before getting distracted. She came back to this toy a lot through out the day. This is a great way for children to have a nativity that they can play with while parents have the untouchable kind.', ' This was so perfect. With a 2 year old and a 4 year old, I needed something that they would be allowed to play with. I remember growing up and always wanting to play with the set my parents had. We were never allowed to touch our s and it was torture! LOL! This one is so cute and fun for the kids. The book that you can buy in addition to this is also great. My kids had a blast reenacting the book with the characters.', ' This was brand new and priced better than most sites I looked at. I think my daughter was more thrilled than my grandson, but he will always have his own Nativity Scene to handle and learn to appreciate what it represents.', ' My grandchildren LOVED it!

My only issue is there is no power switch. To turn it on, you plug it into an outlet. To turn it off, you pull the plug out of the outlet WHILE the popper is still working. Sometimes I can see little arcs of electricity when I pull the plug. I wish I could leave it plugged in all the time and simply push a button or flip a switch to turn it on and off.', ' the air popper does just what you think. it pops a big bowl of popcorn in just about 4 minutes, with no added oil. this is great for you health conscience folks. We use a little olive oil spray on our popcorn once it lands in the bowl to flavor it up a bit. no messy pots.', ' I got it today and made my first batch. I love it! I\\\\m very impressed. The same popcorn I use to pop in a steel pot with lid, pops much larger and fluffier. No more using oil or washing pans. I highly recommend it.', ' Nice popcorn maker. No oil required. I would give it 5 stars, but it doesn\\\\t have an on/off switch, you plug it in and then when it\\\\s done you pull the plug.', ' I purchased the Presto Poplite Hot Air Popper for a friend with some reservation (see below), however, after using it several times my friend was thoroughly satisfied. Originally, I was trying to find a Were-Ever Popcorn Pumper Hot Air Popper that I bought over 30 years ago (USA made) that is still working flawlessly! It has an on/off switch on the base, similar design as the newer ones and affordable! I guess when a company makes something this durable, it eliminates replacement purchases and with no sales you go out of business. 5-Stars for American quality though! As to people complaining about popcorn kernels being thrown out of these poppers, etc. I\\\\ve found that you need to try various brands of popcorn to get one that works best with your popper. Surprisingly, some of the more expensive brands of kernels pop less efficiently in hot air poppers than generic popcorn (those you can buy from bulk containers at stores). You just have to try different brands of kernels and pop your expensive brand in a large pot with canola oil.', ' I should write a review for those of you who have their doubts about the efficiency of yet another kitchen product. I am pathologically spartan and prefer a life with fewer kitchen products. I tossed the big coffee maker, the kitchen aid etc. I use a french press and mix rarely, but by hand. YET, I fully love and embrace this popcorn maker. Hubby no longer burns the popcorn! It pops EVERY KERNEL! It\\\\s amazing! I think we\\\\ve had it about a year, maybe a year and a half and it performs regularly (weekly at least) and flawlessly. And it was CHEAP! (You just plug it in and away it goes - no dials, no settings; butter dish on top works by warming the butter from the ambient heat from the popcorn popper and it works fine.)', ' Don\\\\t know why I\\\\ve been eating less healthy and less flavorful microwave popcorn for all these years. The Presto hot air popcorn popper has quickly become the most used appliance in the kitchen. Works perfect every time. 10 seconds faster then using our microwave. Very easy to clean. Make sure you use a BIG bowl because the 1/2 cup of kernels may not look like much but makes a lot of popcorn. I like drizzling with olive oil afterwords so the salt sticks. Otherwise, all the salt will just end up on the bottom of the bowl. Healthier though not as tasty. Extremely happy with the purchase of my Presto!', ' Works way better than the other hot air poppers I\\\\ve had. Pops far more of the kernels - almost all - than any other. The instructions say to not preheat but it works better when you do; simply remove the hood while you\\\\re doing it. It does tend to blow out some kernels initially; I tilt the whole thing back until it starts popping and that prevents that. If all that sounds too fiddly consider that the results with this popper are simply far better than with others; they suffer from the same small problems this one has and add in major problems of their own (like all those unpopped kernels!).', ' After you load the popcorn in the yellow part hole, you plug it in and the air heats it up and you put a bowl under the opening and literally out shoots flying hot popcorn. Meanwhile the tip top part is heating your butter. It takes a while though to heat the butter. Sometimes all of your popcorn can be completely popped and you still have half heated butter. When the popcorn is finished spitting out all of the popped corn you just unplug it and that shuts it off.', ' We love popping popcorn in this popper. We use it at least once a week, and it\\\\s great knowing what\\\\s in the popcorn, rather than hoping that the microwave stuff won\\\\t kill you. It\\\\s super easy to use, seems to pop nearly all of the kernels every time, and has a place to melt butter for the popcorn. Get a big bowl, because they recommend popping 1/2 cup of kernels (the size of the included scoop/butter container), and that makes a very large bowl of popcorn.', ' I really do like this product, but I am worried about the longevity. After about 20 uses (or less) the lid seems to have warped slightly from the heat. Other than this issue, this product has made making healthier popcorn a breeze, and even cheaper. I purchase the cheap bags of popcorn at the store and get more than triple the amount of popcorn as microwave bags at a fraction of the price. Plus, you can customize your popcorn with seasonings.', ' We eat a lot of popcorn and have gone through many popcorn poppers. We have only used this for 2 weeks but compared to the air poppers we have had in the past this one has been superior. From the time we first put the 1/2 cup of kernels in to when it is done is less than 4 minutes. We do this 4 times to get 2 very large bowls of popcorn. The only thing that would have been nice on it is an ON/OFF switch.', ' Bought this as a gift for my sister and we immediately tried it. I was impressed that the popcorn was very tasty without any oil. I\\\\ve checked back with her and after numerous uses her only complaints are mechanical (you have to turn it off and on by plugging and unplugging it from the wall outlet and it\\\\s pretty noisy) but she\\\\s still liking the taste of the popcorn and loves saving the calories!', ' I got this for my 4 year old grandson who just loves to cook. They used it the first night it arrived and they were tickled with the results. My daughter especially loves the the fact that she can pop the corn without the need for oil. Wonderful, healthy choice. The quality is as expected and appears sturdy enough for the price. We are pleased.', ' I bought this popper for three of my adult married kids for Christmas, as a family gift. They all loved it. The grandkids love watching the popcorn pop. Orville Red. Organic popcorn worked well. Tastes better than microwave popcorn and healthier too! It\\\\s a popcorn popper and works well...don\\\\t over think it people...LOL', ' An excellent popper. I pop the corn into a 12qt Cambro container, melt butter in the microwave, and then put the lid on the container and shake it up. Olive oil is also very good. For best results, use finely ground salt (I use a spice grinder for this purpose).', ' As other reviews have stated this does leave a few unpopped kernels in the bottom. However, overall it is a great machine and the popcorn turns out very tasty. Be sure to have a giant bowl under the chute otherwise it does pop all over the place.', ' We love this popper. I bought one as a gift for Christmas and just purchased another one this week so that my kids and I can enjoy all natural popcorn at home without any chemicals, preservatives, etc.. The kids like to pop it all by their self.', ' Excellent popcorn popper. Can make smaller or larger batches and all the kerrnals pop. Making smaller batches in our old popper prevented all the kernals from popping. With just the two of us, normally we make smaller batches.', ' Got this for our 1st grade niece for Christmas and it was a trip seeing her excitement! This was her favorite gift at Christmas...her own popcorn maker! Hilarious! It worked great and we got to enjoy the popcorn she made!', ' West Bend Air Crazy 4-Qt Popcorn Popper was originally purchased from Walmart. I took it back the next day very poor performance. But the Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Popper worked great the very first time and every time!', ' It\\\\s okay. Better than using a pot on the stove as I had been. I\\\\d prefer if 1/4 of the the kernels didn\\\\t fly out of the chute before popping. Perhaps I need to use a different brand of kernel, but I like my brand.', ' Love making popcorn now. Just fill the cup, turn it on. No mess, no burning, no cleanup! Healthier popcorn cooked on stove or microwave. I save the extra in a ziplock to enjoy later.', ' This corn popper works great. It was very reasonably priced and compact. The popcorn comes out just fine. It requires a large bowl to be placed under the hopper.', ' It works! It\\\\s simple to use and doesn\\\\t make a mess. Having returned another brand because it didn\\\\t work - this works perfectly. No oil. Just corn!', ' Works great love having fresh popcorn and it is so fast and easy. Probably the only bad thing is doesn\\\\t have a on off switch that u just plug it in.', ' Works awesome! I have used it several times. Just get a large bowl to capture all the popped corns. My 7 year old is fascinated by them flying out!', ' Definitely brings back a lot of childhood memories. This is a classic, how can you go wrong. Love the melted butter on top for the finishing touch!', ' Ordered this for my parents because we\\\\ve had ours for over 10 years and they love it as much as we love ours! I\\\\m jealous of the red color! !', ' Made my first batch of popcorn last night. Yummmmmm. My family told me it was just as good, if not better than movie theater popcorn. Win!', ' Perfect popcorn every time Tried other brands prior to this one and this one is the best by far Great tasting popcorn and very healthy', ' Good but not great. Kernels bounce out before any become popped, and kernels remain at the bottom. Plastic top melted before the butter did.', ' It\\\\s decent for coffee roasting, but this is not the circular blower kind. When this one completely melts I\\\\ll likely get a different brand.', ' Works pretty well but the yellow plastic does not Hold up well at all! The small top piece melted horribly and deformed the top opening', ' It doesn\\\\t leave many seeds behind. The cup to melt butter on top works, but I prefer to just do it in the microwave. No complaints.', ' We love the machine, we purchased it a year ago and we use it a lot and it\\\\s still working great. definitely worth the money.', ' Works great! I had it for few moths now and I use it at least 3 times a week. Very good product and the popcorns, perfect!', ' Love popcorn. Get a healthy snack in no time. Using hot air no added stuff. I use organic corn and it pops it well.', ' to paraphrase Cyndi Lauper; She pop he pop and we pop I pop you pop and they pop. What more can you say, it pops.', ' Kids love this thing. They love watching it make popcorn. Its nice that it is air popped as well. Good price.', ' Works great. Bought two other brands neither of which worked very well and left a lot of unpopped kernels.', ' I love this thing! I use this over bagged pop corn and I won\\\\t ever go back. It pops very well!', ' Really no on off switch? Has to be plugged/unplugged to turn on and off. Seems to work ok.', ' LOVE IT! It is so easy to make great tasting popcorn...no move microwave popcorn for us!', ' Great corn popper for the price. Pops nearly every kernel in less than 3 minutes.', ' Delivered on time.

Compact waffle maker doesn\\\\t need much space on counter, or in cabinet. Hot grates make crispy waffles. Easy to pour too much batter making for a messy overflow, but once you get pour down (for this one pour a wide \\\\O\\\\ and quickly close). Also worked well with a gluten/corn/egg free recipe I made for friend with multiple food allergies and made a surprisingly light crisp waffle that was tasty for all the non ingredient sensitive eaters also. High grate temp I think was part of the success. Metal case gets very hot, plastic handle not quite sufficient for easy handling if you\\\\re not paying full attention, got a not so nice burn on my finger that way. Even though it makes great waffles build quality looks nice, but may not be durable for the long haul. I think it will work great for occasional weekend waffles, probably will not last so well if to be used heavily. Handle and adjustment lever appear to be the weak points. For heavy use either think about more expensive model, or look at other brands in this price range. Bottom line: I recommend for occasional home use. If you want a sturdy, quality maker, look at more expensive models.', ' This waffle maker performs as expected, though I wasn\\\\t blown away by the results. As a classic waffle maker (as opposed to a Belgian waffle maker), the waffles are thin, about the thickness of a toaster waffle. The waffles came out crispy on the outside but there wasn\\\\t much room for a fluffy interior. The machine itself is just ok as well. I found the plates to be a little flimsy; there was some looseness in the hinge and as a result the plates didn\\\\t align perfectly. On a positive note, the doneness setting is a nice touch (though is not totally necessary). However, when the batter overflowed a bit (yes they tell you NOT to overfill but the reality is it happens sometimes), the batter dripped into the slider and it was a pain to clean. Another plus is it is compact for easy storage. In the end, this waffle iron went back because of the superiority of thick Belgian waffles.', ' Turns out a very good waffle just like the instructions state use a half of cup batter set the temp control to 3 after it has heated up first of course. Take a few minutes for the light to change and away you go, waffle was golden done. Be prepared to stand there cranking out waffles if you have a crowd, grandkids seem to devour these at a high rate. However the fit and quality control is lacking, the hinge is cheap, and the temp control sliding knob is sloppy. I really expected a better fit and quality control from Cuisinart. That said it operates very well and have no complaints about the waffles it turns out. This was gifted to us for Christmas so I don\\\\t know the purchase price however I would look for this on sale closer to $20.00 than $30.00.', ' This is a little jewel! I did a lot of research because there is a WIDE spectrum of options and associated costs with the waffle maker family... all the way to around $350. The device is well made... a MUST. AND... cleanup typically involves nothing more than a damp cloth...and that is IMPRESSIVE given that I typically use fresh fruit in my batter mix. AND... the temperature control is invaluable. We set ours just under 4 for perfect golden brown waffles. AND...the fact that this waffle maker was designed such that you can stand it up in profile for storage makes the storage convenient.', ' I really enjoy using this little waffle maker. It\\\\s obviously not the most AMAZING thing on the market. It is basic and easy to use and gets the waffle-making job done. It doesn\\\\t have any sort of rising hing on the back, so if you are wanting to make other delicious treats in it (like a bacon grilled cheese sammich) then you will be a little disappointed. I\\\\ve still done it, but you can only cook half at a time as the lid wont close all the way. It would be 100% perfect if the back rose up to evenly cook thicker objects. Though that is not what it is intended to do so you can\\\\t harp on it for that.', ' Got this as a Christmas gift from the in-laws. Love it! It heats up quickly and stays hot. It makes waffles pretty quick, too. It can be a bit tricky to clean since the plates don\\\\t come off. Overall it\\\\s a great waffle maker and we\\\\re super happy with it.', ' I\\\\ve actually purchased two of these waffle irons, one for myself and then a second for my sister because I love mine. It cooks waffles quickly and well, with adjustable heat settings. Love it! I\\\\ve had mine for almost two years with no problems so far.', ' This was also a gift and they were filled with joy, grace and happy with the gift. Thank you Amazon you make on-line, or shopping in General easy fun, safe. It sure beats going to lousey Wal-mart, 5 Big Stars for Amazon !!!!!!!!!!!!!', ' Its hard to clean. And you have to oil it liberally before putting batter on it. I have found that I can scrub it under running water to clean it. It takes a day or so to dry, but after that it turns on and cooks just fine.', ' I can not tell you the amazing and delicious treats we have whipped up in this thing. Homemade waffles, cinnamon bun waffles, macaroni and cheese grilled cheese sandwiches, etc, etc. It is easy to use and economical.', ' This thing makes perfect waffles every time. The batter never sticks no matter what we put in it. It wipes clean in a minute. Once you plug it in it heats really fast. I like the lights that tell you when it is done.', ' Makes the best waffles! I use coconut oil to prevent sticking, which may not even be necessary, and to wipe clean after making waffles. It\\\\s so nice to have real homemade waffles, not the Belgian kind.', ' This is a great little waffle maker. It is very fast which is needed when making breakfast for a family. It is easy to clean - just don\\\\t overfill - about 1/3 seems perfect.', ' So far I have made around a dozen waffles and all of them have turned out perfectly cooked between a 2-3 setting on the machine. Also super easy to clean.', ' Awesome! I was tired of the thick Belgium style waffle and wanted the thinner waffles like my mom used to make. Easy to clean, easy to use, great price.', ' Like this so much, works great, no mess even with the first waffle! Best for small storage as it stands up! Every waffle has come out great!', ' This is one of the few old-fashioned waffle irons I\\\\ve found. It is what I need to make my mom\\\\s Belgian gallettes.', ' works great. Its a waffle maker, it makes waffles. You can make light colored or dark colored waffles but its still waffles. I tried to make it make pancakes but it refused and only did waffles. After that I tried to have the waffle maker make pizza and chicken burritos but it just made waffles that tasted bad. Not the waffle makers fault but you should only try to make waffles nothing else. Oh and it makes waffles, did I mention that?', ' Just exactly what we wanted. A regular waffle maker is hard to find. Thank you.', ' Love it. Exactly as advertised. Gave one to my daughter as a gift, as well.', ' Makes great waffles from light brown to crispy. Easy to use and clean', ' Makes great classic waffles, doesn\\\\t store away easily', ' great pancakes. heats up quickly. cooks enenly.', ' Very nice, good quality and value. Have waffled biscuits and cinnamon rolls as well...Love it.', ' this is the best one made by Cuisinartâ??', ' gave as a gift and he likes it', ' I\\\\m Now a great waffle maker', ' So far so good. Kids love it', ' Best waffle iron!', ' Works great', ' I love it!', ' We do family breakfasts on the weekends with either pancakes or waffles. This pan makes for a fun change and lets us mix things up a little. Pancakes turn out clear but we only do the imprint on one side and then flip them onto a griddle to do the other side. We like to make extra and have a few morning\\\\s worth of breakfasts for our daughter to take to school with her.', ' Excelente', ' Nice', ' I was on the fence for years, finally I jumped in when Amazon had a deal for the skillet. Good pancakes on it. Bacon, steaks, browning your meats. I keep it away from any acidic cooking though. Recently I found out that flaxseed oil is better than veggie oil for coating your Lodge. Clean it using stiff brush and hot water. Dry it really well then coat it thinly with flaxseed oil (using paper towel or kitchen towel). Put it up side down in the oven and bake it for an hour at the highest temperature (ie 450 degrees), no need to preheat your oven. Cool it down in the oven for 2 hours before take it out. Sure enough after 5-6 times, it gives a very nice coating. So happy...', ' I love Lodge cast iron pans, and this was the perfect gift for my bestie. This is just the right size for morning scrambles, pancakes, and pizookies! For indulging or for sharing.', ' The Lodge 8 inch skillet is spectacular for three reasons. First and foremost, the price point on this item (cast iron and made in the USA) is unbeatable. Also, Lodge has a long history and tradition making these skillets. Secondly, these skillets add a dimension of flavor to anything you cook in them -- the idea being that the flavor of the last cooked meal is absorbed into the pan for the next meal. I can vouch for this. Lastly, if seasoned properly (I recommend using olive oil or crisco) the pans are truly non-stick and easy to clean. I debated between 8 inches and 10 inches. A 10 inch skillet is 2.6x the price of the 8 inch. That is, you have to pay 260% more money to get 25% extra cooking room. I don\\\\t think the increase in cooking space (a mere 2 inches) was worth the extra $16 per skillet. Instead, I ordered 2 8 inch skillets...one for meat/eggs/vegetables and the other for fish. If you are cooking for more than 2 people, I would recommend getting the larger skillet. Otherwise, you\\\\ll do just fine with one or two 8 inch skillets.', ' Really like the size of this pan. We have a vacation home in WI where we often have a lot of family join us. It\\\\s been great. I have to say however, it\\\\s huge and I have to fit it over two burners or if it\\\\s on the larger middle burner it takes up almost the whole cooktop. And, it got so close to the knobs that it melted them!!!! So be careful. I didn\\\\t realize mine were plastic even though Electrolux customer service said they should be metal...my cooktop is only 2 years old. Makes me angry and they charge $260 for new ones. Also, get one of those chain male steal cleaners, they work really well.', ' This was a wedding gift that the bride said she really wanted. This was a nice pre-seasoned heavy cast-iron skillet for the price ($15.92 including S&H). I showed it to my wife, who know about this than I do. She agreed it was a nice skillet for the price but felt the surface of it was a bit too \\\\rough\\\\ and that might be a problem with eggs, etc. Therefore I will rate this a 7.75 to 8.25 out of 10 overall!', ' The casting is pretty rough. And mine has some flashing inside the loop of the handle that I may or may not grind out. The factory seasoned coating is pretty terrible. I heated up some sauce and rised it with hot water and I was down to the bare metal. I think once it gets a few layers of seasoning built up on it, it should be good to go.', ' I just received this Lodge pan and washed it and seasoned it again myself. I\\\\m looking forward in using this cast iron pan. I only buy Lodge brand of cast iron. Lodge quailty never disappoints me, this pan is the perfect size for so many things to cook. Another fine product of Lodge that\\\\s added to my collection.', ' It\\\\s a frying pan and does what it\\\\s supposed to do, however,. the finish is not smooth and that is disappointing. I don\\\\t know why the manufacturer won\\\\t go the extra step to provide a smooth finish. I remember my mom\\\\s old frying pans and they had a smooth finish.', ' Liked it so much I ordered 2 for friends. They love it to. Use it all the time. Nice size for a frittata. I make mine with lots of zucchini and 6 eggs and there is room for a few more eggs. Goes straight into oven to cook the top.', ' Perfect size 2 pork loins', ' Cooking with Cast Iron is the only way to go ... Modern skillets just don\\\\t give you the flavor, crispiness, etc. that a cast iron skillet gives. This Lodge Skillet is great ... Highly recommend.', ' Product is great but I received it with what looked like a paint chip where the handle meets the skillet. Contemplated exchanging it but the cost to ship it was too high.', ' Great; eggs never tasted better. But I still find it tough to clean up even using low heat and spraying Pam; otherwise , eggs will stick.', ' Cheap and durable. I wish the handle came with wooden or rubber enclosure. Right now I have to use an oven mitt to raise the skillet.', ' Second one we purchased. Seasoned correctly, it works as well as a non-stick pan without hot spots and the chemical worries.', ' I absolutely LOVE this pan. I use it daily! It cleans well and is pretty much nonstick. I may buy another one!', ' Don\\\\t trust the whole pre seasoned thing. But we all know that. Great product. Good brand. Will buy again', ' Great frying pan for the big jobs. Only problem is that lodge does not make a lid for this 17 pan.', ' This is heavier than I expected but it was a gift and they are younger than I am and they love it', ' Very sturdy and solid just like my Grandma used to have. Love it! Would tell anyone to get one.', ' Haven\\\\t cooked with it yet but it seems like it could be used for effective home defense.', ' like this, but i guess i ron cook ware not for me, i am tiny lady sooo heavy.', ' it really was seasoned, and it\\\\s built like...well, like a cast iron skillet!', ' Yes, I enjoy cooking in cast iron so I gift it to family & friends', ' I\\\\m totally pleased with my lodge pan.

Made in USA', ' Tremendous: meets all expectations', ' It is a Lodge, it is the best!', ' Given as gift. No complaints!', ' I have used this product for a number of years and it works great', ' Easy to install and convenient way of getting filtered water.', ' We love how this filter makes our well water taste.', ' I purchase everytime it runs out.', ' Very good filter I enjoyed it', ' It was a good faucet filter.', ' I have always preferred Pur to other at-home water filtration systems. There is a drastic difference in the flavor of my tap water after it goes through the filter. Even better, I love the taste! More than most bottled waters. The only downside of using a pitcher filtration system is the frequency at which the filter needs to be changed. HOWEVER, I have never found a BETTER VALUE THAN THIS! Finally, I found an affordable source to maintain my Pur pitcher at home!!! This is far more affordable than any deals I\\\\ve found in stores!', ' The filter does its job, for the most part. My San Diegan tap water is filtered from roughly 358ppm in GH to roughly 50ppm. Little to no effect on alkalinity in my experience (which makes sense). Its longevity, however, is left to be desired. A previously advertised 3-month cycle dropped to a 2-month cycle (at least, I believe I recall a 3-month advertising), but so far, my filters have barely been able to last a single month with regular use in a 3 occupant apartment. This makes for a decently costly replacement process.', ' I order these same ones from Amazon. I loved these for the water from my last apartment but the water in my new apartment is not drinkable even when I pour it through the purifier three times. I do use the three time purified to brew coffee though. Sometimes I mix in instant tea. I give five stars because they worked great in my last two apartments.', ' They seem to clog up very frequently. I have to drain the container and shake the filter vigorously to get it to filter effectively again. Other than that they make our chlorine filled tap water taste just as good as bottled water.', ' One of the 3 produced a pretty disgusting tasting water right out of the package. Tried their suggested resolution and it still wasn\\\\t enough. I threw it away. The other 2 have held up nicely and longer than normal.', ' I\\\\ve Been Using These for Years as a Pre-Filter to Remove What I Can Before Filtering Through a Seychelle Radiation Filter. Works Great and at a Better Price than the Box Stores.', ' It drives me nuts how these filters clog up and after a couple of months your water basically doesn\\\\t pass through anymore. They work wonderfully when they\\\\re new though!', ' These work much better than Brita filters, which leave my stainless steel teapot coated with minerals after a half dozen uses. That does not happen with Pur filters.', ' These are filters. They filter water and last longer than two months... the price e is great. I have ordered the same box multiple times and the price is right..', ' Been buying these for my 7 cup pitcher. It lasts about 3 months, but I follow my led indicator. Much cheaper and more convenient than buying water from the store.', ' We\\\\ve been very satisfied with the PUR water filter/pitcher. We bought this 4 pack because it was just a great price!! No issues with the shipping. Good product.', ' Cleans hard water very well, but does not last long.

It is well seasoned, and we take good care of it. The heaviness of this skillet allows for great heat retention and durability. I use it about two times a week. Cleaning is easy since we bought a chain mail scrubber for it. I love this skillet for many types of cooking. Be aware, this is heavy.', ' This is a much larger skillet .... 15 inches. It is used on a regular electric large stove burner. The center is hotter than the edges, but, if you are aware of this and work with it, there are benefits to this characteristic. Preseasoning of the skillet was well done and I love the nonsticking features of the cast iron with the ease of cleaning.', ' This was ordered for my neighbor to make corn bread. I have several Lodge cast iron pans and think they are best for healthy cooking. The first few times you use them food will stick. Just keep using them and wash in hot water with no soap, dry completely and rub with oil. I prefer coconut oil but any vegetable oil will work.', ' Well, I\\\\m not having as much luck with non-stick as I thought I would, but that may be due to my inexperience with cast iron. I\\\\m hoping that I\\\\ll grow into it. Otherwise, it\\\\s a good size, and it was easy to reseason (I accidentally washed with soap and ruined the seasoning). For the price, I think it\\\\s great!', ' We have the larger size of these and wanted smaller ones to make breakfast skillets with. These work great and only get better over time as the seasoning sinks in.', ' This is a well made pan at a very fair price. It cooks well and provides clear instructions for how to care for it.

Also, if the heat coming out or your vents is warm enough to warp these deflectors, you need to call someone to check your heating systems operating temp and duct work.', ' My air registers are flat on the floor and located near the window in most cases. It seemed to me that the warm air went up and warmed up the insulated (but cold) glass of the windows before it circulated into the room, especially in my family room and bedroom which have the vaulted ceiling. These deflectors do give the air a chance to get into the room and the house is more comfortable without turning up the thermostat. Highly recommend for specific situations.', ' We have heating vents positioned in front of french doors, and all the air blew up behind the curtains. These air deflectors are adjustable, made from sturdy plastic, and have magnets at the base to keep them positioned on the vent. They have worked really well at diverting the air flow.', ' Exactly as described. These are PREMIUM air deflectors. They are a lot better quality than the ones I bought at my local hardware store and they do not turn cloudy like the other brand. They are shinny and clear just like the picture and they are very sturdy, not flimsy junk.', ' I can\\\\t vouch for it\\\\s claim of being unbreakable, but I can tell you that it has magnets on the ends, slides to get wider or narrower, and does deflect air. Nothing in particular makes it seem premium, but it works exactly like it\\\\s supposed to.', ' Works great to direct hot air into the room instead of out the windows. I do feel that it has helped keep the rooms warmer. Has not broken despite my accidentally tripping over it several times. Really great product.', ' This one was not labeled Deflecto and is different than an earlier Amazon order of the same item. It doesn\\\\t feel as sturdy, but will be under a desk so it should not be a problem. I\\\\m happy with the product.', ' It\\\\s rediculous how useful these things are. They haven\\\\t changed in 50 years except the stronger plastic, I assume. Absolutely no complaints. Fits under the couch perfectly.', ' Wow! Do these things make a difference in heating my house. The heat goes cross the floor and into the room where it is needed, not strait the the ceiling.', ' Works exactly like it should. I bought them so I could put the night stands closer to the bed, and I haven\\\\t had a cat knock them off yet :)', ' These are the same deflectors as at Home Depot, they are breakable. But do work well, just don\\\\t place where they may be stepped on.', ' I purchased 6 of these deflectors. Perfectly. Has a magnet bottom keeps the deflector in place. I would recommend this item.', ' I love that there is magnets on it but it still falls off with just a bump. Would love if it was a bit stronger.', ' Love that is extends to whatever size and it\\\\s easy to move from one register to the other.', ' Perfect for keeping the air going where you want it. Works great, good quality', ' works as intended, and adjusts to the size of your vent', ' They work great. They stay in place on the ceiling.', ' Sturdy plastic, strong magnets, works as expected.', ' They work great like they say they do.', ' works, my dog keeps moving it tho lol', ' Great product, great seller!', ' Does the job. Sturdy too.', ' ok', ' Great price, we both use these for heartburn. Have for years and they work !', ' Works well. Looks as it does in the picture. Came as described.', ' Works great.', ' Got this as a gift for my mom because her old one broke. She has only been able to use it a few times since she has had it but she likes it a lot. She has said it is just as good as her old one. Shes had two others before this and both have had problems with the cords melting or fraying or failing in some way. We will see if this new one can stand the test of time. These are great little thermometers because they allow you to see an accurate and live display of the temperature without having to open the oven and therefor without losing heat and slowing the cooking.', ' There is a learning curve to this product - finding out how deep it needs to be inserted into the meat. But once you get it, this thermometer is great! You can set a temperature alarm, so you stick the prong into the thickest part of your whole chicken, set the alarm to go off at 165 degrees Fahrenheit, and let the oven and thermometer work together and do the rest! The thermometer has a magnet on the back, so you can stick it to your oven (if metal) or just rest it on the counter top. Then wait for it to beep!', ' This is the first year I\\\\ve cooked a turkey but I\\\\ve seen it done. This thermometer saved me because had I just judged my turkey by its appearance and length of time in the oven, I\\\\d have probably cooked it another two hours! Our turkey wasn\\\\t brown, but the meat was safe and TENDER! Easy to use, highly recommended.', ' This product is great. this was bought as a gift for someone who has one \\\\at home\\\\ but needed one for their 2nd (winter) home. It is great because it still operates the same way. No new buttons or procedures to learn.', ' Love this product ! Took it for my daughter to use Christmas Day and she liked it so much that I gave it to her and ordered another one for myself.', ' This is an attractive, easy to read thermometer. It is accurate and easy to use.', ' Used it Christmas morning cooked an 17 lb Prime Rib. Set at 117. Ding Perfect!', ' Great for smoker, lower temps, not sure if it would hold up in regular grill.', ' So far so good - worked great for a ham and a turkey.', ' Use it all the time, and love it. Very durable.', ' Accurate and well built', ' Works well', ' I want to buy it!', ' This was a long-overdue purchase for me. I\\\\ve been cooking more lately, and so many of my favorite recipes call for grilling that I finally broke down and bought this pan. It does take a bit longer to clean, so I bought a brush for it also.', ' This is a nice grill pan that effectively puts grill marks on food. So far I\\\\ve only used it on seafood (scallops and shrimp). The size is perfect in that it covers but does not exceed the size of my gas burners. Iron is a surprisingly poor conductor of heat and will develop problematic hot and cold spots if the pan is much bigger than the burner. This one (10.5 inch) is the biggest size I could use with confidence that it would heat evenly. The seasoning held up well after the first couple of washings. I wouldn\\\\t be surprised if I need to season it myself at some point soon, but that\\\\s not a problem. On the whole a solid addition to one\\\\s kitchen arsenal.', ' This is a fantastic pan for searing meat. We typically cook in our Sous Vide but then we need to brown our meat. This pan is perfect. It is a tad heavy (it is a cast-iron pan). Pretty simple to clean as well. We bought the set which included the scaper and the silicone hot handle. Trust me, you will need both of these items to avoid burning yourself and to help with cleaning the pan. When searing the meat, make sure you have your oven fan on as it creates a lot of smoke. Fantastic product!', ' Never had one of these before and a friend of mine had made some meat on something similar and I was impressed. These seemed to be affordable but also good size and quality. Got 1 as a gift for my brother and one for myself. Having used it a few times it always cooks meat well but can be a little hard to clean the first few times. Their website has an excellent video for how to care for it. Im confident that with proper usage and care this will likely last longer than I do.', ' This little grill pan is a whiz at making those grill marks and giving that grilled flavor. I prefer to cook inside inpy because you can never count on the weather. So a grill pan is a must for me. I have had other pans but for the price this will do pertly well. This pan made the perfect grill marks on veggies as well as meat. For meat, you wil want it on medium high to sear and then lower your temps to medium to cook.', ' i have been wanting a cast iron skillet for years now. Now i finally have this one and i could not be any happier. The price was perfect. It is very heavy as it should be. The grates on the inside of the pan are very nice. I cant wait to use this pan for all my indoor grilling needs.', ' The pan is really hard to clean. I use pure vegetable oil and a lot of paper towels. I was told I should not use water and soap on cast-iron pans. I find myself using my toaster/oven for my grilling. Nancy', ' Lodge has always been a go to when it comes to my stove top cooking needs. I love the ridges on this pan. Just as good as cooking on a grill. Leaves great grill marks and is seasoned perfect!', ' Can\\\\t go wrong with lodge. Holds more than I thought it would and use with the panini press to make perfect paninis. Better than any panini press I ever used.', ' Great heavy-duty pan! A little hard to clean between ridges. I highly recommend this pan.', ' Bought this for my husband for Christmas 2014 and he uses it all the time. Great quality.', ' The best cast iron skillet i have had', ' Heavy enough to beat kill a yak.', ' Best investment for my kitchen.', ' Very easy to use. super heavy.', ' great for indoor grilling!', ' Perfect size for steaks', ' Great quality :)', ' I like this one!', ' works great!', ' good heavy', ' Luv it.', ' Love it', ' 1', ' VERY HARD TO CLEAN!!!', ' Yay! I have had the same coffee maker for years. I love it. It makes coffee the way I like, and I know how to use it. I was HORRIFIED when my husband broke ours in the sink when making a pot for us one morning. While the world did not stop turning, I believe it may have slowed down for a moment. A moment of shocked silence. While he went about the business of cleaning up the mess, I hopped online to see if we could get a new one. Oh, the JOY when I found this. It doesn\\\\t match the machine, but it works and fits great. Mornings around our home have become bright and happy once again!', ' Love this pot! We\\\\ve been using a (identical) pot that came with our machine for two years with a broken lip/spout. This caused the coffee to leak everywhere every time we poured! I had no idea this replacement pot existed, and I am so glad it does! Same quality as original- but without broken spout out of the box.', ' Beautiful! Delivered in record time, after the destruction of my carafe, I only had to get up, get dressed and go get coffee one morning. I love Amazon!!', ' Was an exact replacement for the Glass pot that came with the coffeemaker. Very happy with it!', ' Perfect quality. I was SO happy to replace my broken carafeâ?? at this price.', ' $$ but necessary as the pot that came with the coffee machine broke.', ' Works great, perfect fit for my old coffee maker', ' Had to replace the carafe so this worked well', ' Bought as a replacement for a broken one', ' Overpriced, but still works.', ' replacement works well.', ' Works perfectly!', ' works perfect', ' Works great.', ' perfect pot!', ' Fit perfect.', ' Now this is a baster! Love the stainless since I don\\\\t have to worry about it melting like the cheap plastic ones I have had in the past. The brush is an excellent addition and makes cleaning a breeze. Haven\\\\t tried the injector yet, but I did play around with it with some water, and it appears to work very well, so I plan to use it on roasted chicken soon. Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.', ' Wanted a stainless steel baster as an alternative to the plastic one I used for years. Also like the injection needle and cleaning brush. Then used the old plastic baster in the garage for sucking out old brake fluid and adding fresh brake fluid in my vehicles. Try to change out the brake fluid every year which fresh fluid.', ' I\\\\ve only used it once, but it feels durable and I expect it to last.', ' don\\\\t have use spoon for baking or roasting any more', ' A real deal given the injection needle.', ' great product. Fast shipment. A+++++', ' works good and cleans up easy.', ' Works fine.', ' Excellent', ' perfect', ' LOVE IT', ' Tried it for the first time. Heated up fast. Super soft and the girlfriend loved it! She plugged it in and within minutes it was warm. Just as described and can\\\\t beat the price. Super nice travel case that comes with it as well.', ' Kids love it!', ' This is the BEST Raw Honey on the market, as far as Organic goes. I am looking for non-gmo that is a great price, but have yet to find one! But, I do LOVE this brand!', ' I stir a teaspoon in my tea every morning. Tastes great and feels good that it\\\\s healthy stuff. Would recommend. I haven\\\\t tried cooking with it yet.', ' LOVE this honey... i can\\\\t afford to get it very often, but when i can, it makes me feel better, I hope I can get more for the winter months!!', ' This is awesome honey. It isn\\\\t too sweet. The consistency is different from your regular, comes-in-a-bear honey but I like it even better.', ' I like the taste of this honey. Most honey that I have bought has an artificial after taste to it but not this one.', ' This is the second time I purchased this honey and I love the quality! I won\\\\t buy another brand.', ' Best face cleanser. Mix 50/50 with yogurt for a weekly facial, let dry and rinse.', ' Very good honey.

Wonderful taste and it\\\\s easy to use.', ' We buy this all the time', ' My favorite Raw honey!', ' The price has increased everywhere on this product, and this is about the best price I can find (with free Prime shipping). This is a tasty way to get your C and other minerals on a daily basis. I have mixed it with green drinks and powders, and the orange flavor is nice with the green flavors. If I feel a cold trying to catch me, I double the dose daily--seems to help.', ' This stuff works so great. I swear by it. I\\\\m not crazy about the flavor, so I let it fizz up in a few tablespoons of water. As soon as it\\\\s done being super fizzy, I drink it fast then rinse the glass with another tablespoon or so of water and drink the rest down. My favorite flavor of all of them for sure.', ' I\\\\m not usually a giant fan of these flavored things to make you feel better. But this taste great and works great. I drink one every night and it helps me sleep as well as making me feel better during these months of sickness we are in. ð??? I\\\\m very happy with this product.', ' love that I can order this on Amazon--I take it often during the winter to boost my immune system and being able to get on the computer and get it sent to my door makes my life easier!', ' We like it.

Top is before and bottom is after.', ' I remembered my granny used rose petal and witch hazel and I ordered and WOW!!!! It is a seven Natural wonder,I have ordered my second one, my skin looks like 25 five years ago (I am 60) I used it before my serum and my night cream.', ' I am in love with this toner. I have super sensitive skin with occasional hormonal breakouts and this helps soothe everything. I have even noticed that the breakouts are less severe when I use this on a regular basis. I am a forever fan!', ' I purchased this product with the intentions of it clearing my small amount of zits and helping in keeping my face hydrated seeing how many people who used it had great results from this.After receiving this bottle of Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera,I was disappointed in seeing how the bottle came really dirty looking.Its also a little chipped in the cap but it didn\\\\t spill or anything which is fine with me.The smell alone makes me melt.It smells so darn good.After using it just once on my face,it felt so hydrated.Feels so fresh.I absolutely fell in love with the scent.As I kept on using it,my zits have basically banished.I do have blackheads but other than that,my face is basically clear.They say that Witch Hazel helps fade away dark spots,which is another reason as to why I purchased the product.Hopefully as I continue to use this,my dark spots from previous acne will fade away.', ' I\\\\m 55 an have been having terrible issues with cystic acne breakouts on my chin, along with really dry skin. Loreal\\\\s Alcohol Free Hydrating Facial Toner has always worked really really well for me, but has not done anything to alleviate these issues, plus, I\\\\ve been trying to switch over to products from cruelty free companies. This product popped up on Amazon while I was searching for another toner, and the reviews were very good. My sister swears by witch hazel for a ton of uses, so I thought, what the heck, I\\\\ll try it. I\\\\ve only been using it about a week, and so far I like it a lot. It is so gentle, and seems to be helping clear up my skin. It doesn\\\\t dry my skin at all. I\\\\m hoping this continues. My skin is so sensitive and a lot of products really irritate it. I would recommend to try if you have sensitive skin, acne issues, or simply want a gentle, cruelty free toner.', ' This toner is very gentle and does not have a strong smell to it. I love using it and will continue to purchase it into the future.', ' My friend recommended this so I ordered it. Love it!! My skin has not had any breakouts and it seems to tone down any redness.', ' I have been using this toner for about 4 years now and I love it. It never breaks me out it actually calms my skin. I like to use it in the am to remove my nighttime moisturizers like you would a cleansing water. It balances my combo complextion and never strips my skin. I love the light rose scent it\\\\s not over powering at all. I also like how all the tannins are in the witch hazel it really makes for a better skin in my case. A bottle lasts me about 3 months with daily use. I always have backups on hand because it is just that good. If you\\\\re looking for a gentle toner that won\\\\t strip your skin and doesn\\\\t break me out at all. Love this for combo and dry skin I can see it working well. Honestly I\\\\d say all skin types because it\\\\s just so gentle. Definitely a toner to try its one of the best I have ever used.', ' I love the smell of this stuff. It smells so fresh and clean with a light sent of rose. I use it every day usually twice a day. If my skin feels hot it cools it down. If my skin feels dry and tight I can swipe this on my face and it will feel refreshed and moisturized. Its great for my oily skin and it cleans so well. Even after I do a deep clean ( mud mask and exfoliation) this stuff can still remove dirt left in my skin. I have always heard about how wonderful witch hazel is for your skin but I don\\\\t know why I waited so long to try it. I LOVE this stuff and I don\\\\t think my skin care routine will ever be the same :)', ' This toner is amazing. I have been using witch hazel for years, but found that the alcohol in most brands was over-drying my skin. I found this brand online on pinterest and decided to try it, since it is alcohol free. I am so happy I did! I tend to wake up with puffy eyes and this helps me look awake, rested, and like I am actually a morning person. It soothes redness and irritation due to acne and leaves my skin smelling like a fresh cut rose. Since using it, I have had fewer breakouts and I can tell the difference in the overall appearance of my skin. This product is the best!', ' I wish I had taken a before photo. I have really bad acne scarring and within days of using this product along with my acne scar treatment I have seen way more of a difference than just with the treatment I had before. Witch hazel pulls excess dirt out of the skin and helps with puffy eyes, wrinkles, acne, acne scarring, stretch marks, eczema, etc. The fine lines that were forming on my neck have already lessened and it\\\\s helping with my chest wrinkles that were forming from sleeping on my stomach. Best $10 I\\\\ve ever spent and I\\\\ve seen more of a difference from this than any of my $60+ creams/ oils/ treatments I\\\\ve bought. Ordering the 3 bottle package next time.', ' I\\\\m a guy in my late-20\\\\s with somewhat problematic skin. I used to use Dickinson\\\\s Witch Hazel, but switched to Thayers after I decided the alcohol in Dickinson\\\\s brand was drying out my skin. I use this product as a skin toner as part of my morning regimen. Pros: - Smaller pores in t-zone - Less dirt and blackheads - Nice smell - Leaves face feeling clean Try it out, it\\\\s cheap - if it doesn\\\\t work for you, you won\\\\t feel too bad.', ' This is the second time I ordered this toner. I have been using it ever since my friend recommended it to me. It has a light rose fragrance that is very soothing. It is a good toner to keep your skin moisturized (but you still need some lotion on top of this). It is a good foundation to give enough of moisture to you face but not greasy at all. I use it without anything else in the summer in the night.', ' I love this stuff! I started using it in conjunction with a new type of face wash, and soon after my skin began to improve a lot - I still have pimples, but way fewer than I used to. For a while I actually thought the face wash was what was helping most, but when I ran out I couldn\\\\t replace it for a while so just continued to use this and a cheaper face wash - my skin has continued looking awesome!', ' This smells really fresh. The bottle has a lot of product. I have been using this for about 3 weeks and the bumps on my forehead are fading and my overall skin has improved. i have been using this with other natural skin care products and they work well together because of the natural ingredients. I would repurchase this. I only put 4 stars because i didnt see it do anything major for my skin.', ' Thayer\\\\s is known in the wet shave community for making a wonderful non-alcohol based aftershave. This particular one has not only witch hazel, but aloe and rose water. It smells like a spring bouquet and leaves the skin feeling smooth and clean. I recommend this if you are looking for a non-alcohol based A/S. Thayer\\\\s has a wonderful product.', ' I like this product very much. It\\\\s alcohol free, contains aloe vera and other natural ingredients. It doesn\\\\t dry out my skin and removes the last remaining traces of makeup after I wash my face. The rose petal scent is subtle and not offensive. Another plus is the bottle is plastic, not heavy glass. I will definitely buy this again.', ' Love this product!! It\\\\s noticeably shrunk my pores and even after I wash my face with face wash and think I got all the dirt off I use this stuff on a cotton ball and I see how much was left on my skin. It\\\\s cleared my face breakouts completely in less than 2 weeks. Amazing atuff.', ' I like Thayers witch hazel for my sensitive skin. The aloe in it is an added ingredient I haven\\\\t found in other brands of witch hazel, and also is good for dry sensitive skin and minor insect bites. Good seller, with fast shipping makes it a win-win purchase!', ' I bought this in hopes of reducing redness and razor bumps after shaving my face/neck area. So far I am very pleased and am excited to continue using. I have even noticed that my pores appear to be smaller. Smells great too and fast shipping!', ' Came in fast. The bottle was little smaller than I thought it would be. But, that is okay. It is going to take forever for me to go through the bottle. I have used it on my face a few times and it feels very nice. I do enjoy this product!', ' After using this, my face hasn\\\\t felt and looked this great in years. My face is incredibly smooth and balanced now, with most to all of my acne gone! I definitely recommend this product and I will definitely be purchasing this again!', ' This is by far the best toner I\\\\ve used. I have very sensitive skin that tends to be a bit oily. This toner is gentle without drying, keeps oil at bay, and is helping to even my complexion. Will certainly be buying it regularly.', ' It arrives in a plastic bottle. After using last night, I woke up to a clean and clear face, without the oiliness I\\\\m usually greeted with (extra plus--my face didn\\\\t feel dry). Would recommend to other buyers.', ' I love doing my DIY facials or some I bought on here, (I.e. Dead Sea mud mask) and it\\\\s honestly so great! I feel like it hydrates my skin where it needs to, and it evens IG out! Love the smell also.', ' Exactly the same witch hazel I have been using for years, but now with a better bottle! This is a key component of my soap-free face care, and probably the #1 reason for my great skin. Quick delivery!', ' I have only been using this product a few days and I already see a difference in my skin. My pores seem much smaller! This is great for sensitive skin, acne-prone skin. So happy I found this product.', ' This is the first time using a toner since I was a teen. I use a facial oil cleanser and use this afterwards and noticed a difference within the first few days. My new go to.', ' I\\\\m not really sure what it\\\\s supposed to do besides moisturize my face.. well that\\\\s all it does for me. I like the smell. I don\\\\t really know what else it\\\\s doing for me.', ' Ok but cheap container. It fell off my counter (as all of us girls have a ton of stuff on our sinks!) And the lid broke. I still use it but now it\\\\s evaporating away.', ' I always buy this as toner, and it\\\\s great stuff. Smells great, feels great on my skin. I also have been using it to make essential oil sprays which has been great!', ' I love this product. It is not drying to my skin and helps clear anything left on my face after washing. Has a neutral to refreshing smell unlike plain witch hazel.', ' It makes my face feel so much cleaner, after using my rotator brush to clean my face. Not the best smell but it\\\\s good. Burns a little also if any cuts on the face.', ' This is a very nice witch hazel. I love the rose and the fact that there\\\\s no drying alcohol in it, makes for a lovely, gentle toner. Very recommended!', ' This toner smells amazing! Just like roses and is very gentle but cleansing to my skin. I usually make my own toner but I\\\\m sold on this one now!', ' Good product for the price. I have used this for over a year now and i think its good. Not life changing, but definitely the best toner ive tried', ' Very good product leaves my skin fresh and has a really nice smell I just purchased it a couple weeks ago and being using in it every since', ' So good for my skin and such a treat to wipe on in the morning and night :) Arrived quickly and well packaged. Very happy with seller!', ' I use this post face-wash and it provides a gentle and refreshing toner that helps keep my skin clean and clear. I highly recommend it!', ' One word: AMAZING. I have been using this product for about a week now and have noticed dramatic results. After washing my face with a mid soap, followed by a scrub, ,I apply this toner. Before I describe the results, let me just say that this product came nicely packaged and I really liked the inside label! The rose petal scent is very attractive and not overpowering. What I think I like most about this product is that it is alcohol-free and is not harsh on my sensitive skin. Most other toners dry my skin out..this toner actually provides moisture to my skin. Some days, I don\\\\t even apply a moisturizer on afterwards, because my skin is so soft. After just a week, I have noticed a healthy PH balance in my skin. My pores are noticeably smaller, and my skin just looks more even-toned and cleaner. LOVE this product, and will be using it everyday, sometimes twice a day if need be. I will recommend this toner to anyone!', ' This stuff makes my skin so nice. Warning, I had oily skin so people with less oily skin may dry out if they use it twice a day.', ' I really really like this product.

Great for Rosacea.', ' I love this product, I love the scent , the fact that there is no alcohol. I look forward to trying other scents.', ' Speedy delivery and great product! I use it every night after washing my face and it\\\\s a great natural toner.', ' I have tried everything, and this is the best! I use it twice a day morning and night for best results.', ' like everyone else I love this stuff. be sure to get alcohol free unless you want a drying effect.', ' Very pretty scent but I\\\\m going back to the lavender, simply my preference. Alcohol free.', ' Love this stuff! Makes my face feel super clean and smooth! Will be repurchasing!', ' Love it! Really great product and will definitely continue to buy this product!!', ' Love all Thayer witch hazel products. This is my personal favorite. Great toner', ' I love it it smells wonderful and it makes my skin look and feel great!', ' I was scared of getting this product at first because of the bad reviews saying they would make your face breakout or make it oily, but this product did wonders for me. i have an evenly balanced face, not too oily and not too dry; however every single time I get my eyebrows threaded, tons of pimples break out around my eyebrows the next day. I used this product for 3 days before I got my eyebrows threaded and on the day I got them threaded, and absolutely no breakouts around my eyebrows or anywhere else on my face. 10/10', ' This toner smells SO NICE. I actually look forward to using it.', ' Got this for my mother and she said it felt nice on her face', ' Absolutely the best I have tried. It leaves my skin sooo soft and clean. I use it on my eyes to gently wipe away any liner after I wash my face and it just is beyond words how much better my skin is using this product. The bottle had a little hole in it but none spilled out in the box it came in. It was just when I grabbed the bottle I noticed some spillage, but I had an empty squeeze bottle I use for toners so it was fine.', ' I pour this on a cotton pad and wipe my face after cleansing. It visibly tightens the pores, which is what I hoped for. It has a nice rosy scent. I swapped my old Dickinson witch hazel for this because it\\\\s alcohol-free. I have combination/dry skin, so I have to use moisturizer, but anyone who uses toners should be doing so anyway. And it also wipes away any trace of makeup that has failed to leave my face...It\\\\s great!', ' Works well with my skin. I use it on a daily bases.', ' This was received quickly and in great shape from the seller. I love the smell and how gentle it is. It seems to be very good on my face and I am already halfway through the bottle (it\\\\s been a few months) so I know it\\\\s definitely non irritating. I have very sensitive skin that is going through a lot of changes (post-partem and nursing), this has helped balance my skin.', ' This product is great- it smells really nice and makes my skin feel very soft and refreshed. I was hoping it would help with my acne (I have a few small breakouts here and there) but it has not really done much for that--still working on getting the right combo of products/ routine. But I like that this is natural product and has been around for a while, would recommend.', ' Excellent toner.Cleans without striping your skin', ' I love this product! It makes my face feel refreshed & diminshes the puffiness under my eyes. The price is affordable compared to high end products that contain tons of chemicals. It feels good knowing that I\\\\m using something with natural ingredients, and that it actually works!', ' Would give it 5 stars if it was a bit cheaper.', ' It seems to be clearing up my acne!!!! :) :)', ' I did a bunch of research on facial cleaning products, bought a bunch of stuff, and this ended up being the best. I will do face wash and toner only sometimes. It makes my skin not look dried out, because it doesn\\\\t have alcohol as one of the ingredients. I have dark brown skin, and this stuff was my best skin purchase in months.', ' i like it , i think i will buy it again.', ' A great astringent... and smells lovely!', ' i bought this after I had read about Rose water making peoples skin clear and even toned. I don\\\\t have really bad acne, but I wanted something to even out my skin tone. It was okay. I wasnt really thrilled with the results, and ended up giving it away after a couple weeks of trying it.', ' Don\\\\t usually write reviews but i love this toner.

Wow! One day and the dry skin started to look like new again. Heck, I asked my wife to apply some to the dry skin on my back (an annual problem for me) and it moisturized it perfectly. In the winter, I only use the product about 3-times a week on my hands and feet. That is all it takes it is so good. And for my back, the foot cream is applied once a week. However, my wife uses the hand and foot cream daily and loves it.

Now he can keep them off the floors!', ' thx', ' I make chicken stock fairly frequently (huge advantage of a pressure cooker) and this makes the process even easier. It just takes a few minutes after pouring in the broth for most of the fat to rise and any heavy gunk to settle. Then pour off the goodness, dump the ugliness, and get another batch in the Oxo while it\\\\s all still warm. Of course great for making gravy after roasting a bird too. Clean up is easy in the sink. Just don\\\\t lose the all-important red plug!', ' Admittedly I\\\\m an OXO fanboy. I\\\\ve slowly begun replacing everything in my kitchen with OXO product because the quality is outstanding, pricey but worth it. Seldom to they miss. This fat separator is no exception. I went with the four cup capacity version, because I ready have a two cup capacity measuring cup, with this I can cheat and measure up to four cups. It works great, and I really appreciate the no slip Good Grip when dealing with greasy animal drippings. Precise measuring allows you to use the perfect amount of drippings for your gravy or stock. She stopper works great to keep fat out of the tube. The strainer keeps large debris like bay leaves and rosemary sprigs out of your gravy. An all around performer.', ' I purchased this as a gift to my husband to replace a different brand that had cracked after a year of use. This design is much more efficient than the ones with a pour hole at the bottom. We are able to take hot liquid from the pressure cooker and separate it immediately without fear of damaging the product. Awesome product that functions as it advertises.', ' My fiancé loves his fat separator. It is especially great for gravies made from poultry basting, etc. The gray sifter and red stopper are both removable for ease of cleaning. Easy to handle and choice of different sizes allow you to pick what is best for the storage space you have available.', ' Another great OXO product. Whenever I need anything kitchen related I always check first to see if an OXO item is available....have never let me down yet. Might cost a bit more but not a whole lot and more than makes up for it in quality and durability.', ' Bought this as a Christmas present for my mother in law.

It feels very comfortable in my hand despite being about an inch longer than the chef\\\\s knife I\\\\m used to using. I was a little worried that the handle would feel like cheap plastic, but it\\\\s a bit softer and feels substantial. I have only been using it a few weeks, but I\\\\m hoping it is good enough quality for it to be professionally sharpened when it needs it. I will write a follow-up review after sharpening to note whether it holds an edge.', ' For a budget knife, these are superb! If you\\\\re not a professional chef, there really is no need to spend $100 on a knife (and my husband says that he\\\\s read that even some chefs use this knife and recommend it). We use them for cutting pretty much everything. Even raw potatoes and carrots are so easy to slice with these! We ended up getting two for ourselves and one for my brother-in-law. They keep a sharp edge longer than most other knives I\\\\ve had. Remember to only hand wash them and never use them in the dishwasher if you want them to keep their sharp edge for a long time. I believe we ended up sharpening the older knife with a regular knife sharpener and it still works beautifully. I think we\\\\ve had the first one for about 3-4 years and the second one almost as long.', ' I was on the verge of getting a shun chefs knife. I was pretty hesitant to do it because of the price. I saw several recommendations to get this instead of the shun and they were all absolutely correct. This knife is a very budget friendly knife that exceeds all expectations. I\\\\ve used it several times since receiving it and I can tell you, it\\\\s very sharp!! If you are thinking of getting a good mid priced knife, the Victorinox set is all you need. I got this one, the slicer, and two paring knives. Victorinox has knocked it out the park with this set. The handles are very comfortable and the blades are ultra sharp. They are stamped and not forged though...so I\\\\ll come back after using this for a while and update with the durability.', ' I finally broke down and purchased a good chefs knife after being continually frustrated by cheap (junk )knives. I haven\\\\t had much opportunity to use it yet. My initial impressions are that I really like it. It\\\\s plenty sharp out of the box. The handle fits my large hand well, I\\\\m 6\\\\5. The textured Fibrox handle provides plenty of grip even with wet or slimy hands.', ' I like this fibrox handle. It doesn\\\\t get slippery when wet. It has a good hand feel. This is my first and only large kitchen knife. I use it to cut fruit, lettuce, veggies, chicken breasts. I don\\\\t carve meat off bones so this knife suits most of my needs. I\\\\ve had it about two years and it does feel less sharp, but I abuse it by cutting on plastic instead of digging out the cutting board. Even then, it still cuts fine, just not that amazing sharpness from when it was new. I usually wash it and stick it on a rack to dry. It hasn\\\\t rusted or pitted. It comes with a little plastic storage sheath but I don\\\\t use that.', ' I am a student who enjoys cooking when I have spare time. I use this as my main chef\\\\s knife. This knife is extremely sharp and does the job. Whenever my boyfriend and I cook alongside each other, we jokingly fight over this knife and dread using the other knives in my kitchen. The weight is heavy enough to be able to add some power with every chop (though don\\\\t slam your knives into anything!). The handle is a bit bulky and may not fit as comfortably for women with very small hands (I\\\\m 5\\\\2\\\\\\\\ 110lbs). However, it has not caused me much distress otherwise.', ' Good investment, sharp. Only downside is that food gets stuck on it. You slice an onion and have the onion slices stuck on the knife. But for the price, it sure gets the job done and saves your time on those blunt dead expensive trash called knife sets. I returned 3 different sets of Calphalon knife set cos each time they got broken, annoying part was that they were dead blunt and expensive. Buy this knife and slice or dice like a pro chef. You\\\\ll be grateful you did.', ' Right out of the package I thought this knife was going to be my go-to knife. 1 month later I went to slice a tomato and I struggled to slice it. The tomato was very ripe but I would have expected that this knife could have handled that. So I\\\\m not sure what the longevity of these knives are yet, or how much effort it will take to keep them sharp.', ' This is the best chef\\\\s knife I have ever used. I\\\\m not a chef, but I do cook regularly in my home kitchen. This knife feels great in the hand, it is easy to wield, and it is super sharp. After a few months of regular use, it\\\\s showing no signs of dullness. I bought a second one, and a sheath for each, so we don\\\\t have to wash mid-cook.', ' Purchased this knife after reading reviews. It is definitely worth every penny. Yes, there are more expensive chef\\\\s knives out there, but this one is comfortable to handle, sharp to make quick work out of chopping! I didn\\\\t realize how bad my old chef\\\\s knife was until using this one. I actually enjoy chopping now! Highly recommend!', ' If you need to decimate some produce with utmost precision, this is the knife for you. I use this thing all the time as my primary workhorse in the kitchen. The grip does not slide in my hand and the blade remains sharp after multiple uses. This knife is rated #1 on Amazon for a reason.', ' This is THE knife to buy if you don\\\\t want to spend a lot on a good knife. I read so many professional reviews by various cooking related sites and they all said that for the money this is the best. Now that I have it, I totally agree. Very sharp and thin blade. Great value for money.', ' This is the best knife that I ever purchased. It is very sharp and very easy to cut through vegetables. I haven\\\\t used it yet on meat. I\\\\m sure it will work just as well. I can understand all of the positive reviews on Amazon. I did only receive it a week ago, but so far, so good.', ' I did not want to buy another chef\\\\s knife, but I bought this knife after seeing it rated very highly on America\\\\s Test Kitchen. I am very pleased with the quality and sharpness of this knife. This knife gives you all the performance you need but it costs much less than a Wusthof.', ' The reviews are right about this knife. I have knives that are 10 times the price that cannot slice as easily or hold an edge like this knife can. For the price you just can\\\\t go wrong. It looks like a $35 blade, as it should. It cuts way above it\\\\s weight class though.', ' This is truly one of the best knives I have ever used. My father always had original Wusthof and Henckels knives while I was growing up, but this cuts just as smooth with the right weight to get any job done. Especially for the price, this is one the best knives to get.', ' Praise be my Mom finally bought this knife. Just about lost it trying to cut even the simplest vegetables. Makes slicing, dicing, and chopping enjoyable again. You won\\\\t be disappointing with this high quality and value knife.', ' This is my daily go-to knife. I used to own two restaurants and had very expensive brand knives but this is a real workhorse and I love the balance and fell of it.', ' The sharpest knife I have ever experienced in my life. It is the knife I go to for everything. I like Victorinox knives so much I have been ordering a bunch of different ones and up to now I have not been disappointed.', ' Great economical knife. Watch the product comparison on YouTube by Test Kitchen. You won\\\\t be disappointed. Comparing these to high end German/Japanese knives would be obsolete.', ' This one was a gift, I like mine so much. These are truly \\\\bang for your buck\\\\ knives. I use a Spyderco Sharpmaker when it\\\\s dull, does a great job bringing back the edge.', ' Great Knife, Very sharp and comfortable to handle. The blade is a little thin and that makes it lighter then other knives I have used but for the money you cant beat it', ' This is one beautiful knife. This Victorinox can slice through chicken joints like they were nothing and still finely cut sushi grade tuna. I love it.', ' Best kitchen knife I\\\\ve ever owned. Useful for a large variety of tasks, very sharp and holds it sharpness, well designed grip and form factor.', ' Bought this because it was recommended on America\\\\s test kitchen. Great buy. Does exactly what you\\\\d expect from a chef\\\\s knife.', ' Love these knives. Bought another one after I got my first. They\\\\re not the prettiest, but they keep an edge and are sharp.', ' So far so good. Very sharp out of the box. Very comfortable handle. A little light weight for me but not a big problem.', ' Very happy with the quality of this knife,victorious are a great value compared to so called higher end knives..', ' I cut my finger cleaner than I have with any other knife before! 5/5 would cut again!', ' One of the best values for a quality chef knife. Cooks Illustrated rated very highly.', ' Good knife. Feels good in hand with balance and weight. Well priced.', ' Best knife for the money. Sharp out of the box and holds a good edge.', ' Very good knife. I bought it for my wife and she loves it!!', ' amazing quality for the price, truly a professional product', ' Really excellent knife. There\\\\s not much else to say.', ' Excellent knife for a good price. Holds a good edge.', ' Awesome knife , very sharp !! Whatch your fingers !', ' I already nicked my thumb. It\\\\s shaaaaaaaaaarp!', ' I HAD NO CLUE that my sharp knives were SO DULL!!! That is until I used my (first ever) BRAND NEW Chefs knife for the first time. I was making yakisoba stir fry with broccoli, cabbage and onions. Usually it would take some muscle pressure to cut through the tough broccoli stalks and cabbage head..and my hands would always be sore as well because of my fibromyalgia. I ENTERED A BLISSFULL NEW WORLD!!! This knife literally cut through the broccoli LIKE BUTTER. BEAUTIFUL, THIN SLICES with NO EFFORT or discomfort! I think my eyes must have bugged out, but I KNOW I started giggling like my son when he got his new xbox! I grabbed the cabbage and YES, IT TOO took no effort. ..NOT EVEN when cutting straight through the center stalk (something I would have said was impossible without a HATCHET). It cut such amazingly uniform and thin slices that they curled at the tips. The onion cut like a soft boiled egg...I am IN LOVE with this AND the FILLET knife I also purchased. It cut the steak perfectly. These knives are a pleasure to use. I wholeheartedly recommend them to any and everyone looking for quality cutlery. The price is SO LOW compared to what my brother (a REAL Chef) paid for his..I could buy a used car with what he paid for all of his blades! I ABSOLUTELY plan on getting the rest of the set as soon as I can. ..and heaven help anyone (hubby or teen son) that I catch using them for ANYTHING other than cutting food lol. These are mine..All MINE! :)', ' very sharp , very reliable', ' This knife is amazing!!!', ' Nice and sharp!', ' Excellent knife.', ' This is a sturdy little battery minder. I use these only to maintain good batteries in or out of vehicles. I\\\\ve had the bad experience of buying two store brand battery minders, only to have them both stop working after about a year. They also seemed to run very hot on. A friend of mine was given one of these Deltran units as a gift and has been using it for a couple of years. So far I am very happy with mine. It is nice and solid, with enough weight from the internal transformer that is stays where it\\\\s put.', ' This keeps my 25 year old Porsche 928 charged and ready to ride. In the coldest weather we have seen in the carolinas (22F) i went out and cranked the car without an issue. Works as advertised, Small footprint, and very well designed.', ' Works great very happy with my purchase. No more dead batteries through the winter to spring months. I have had this unit for a few years now and its rock solid.', ' I had one of these many years ago, and it worked well. These have improved features and are even better. They have very well made, and should last for years.', ' Bought for car that is not driven during winter months. I don\\\\t have to remove battery to put on charger, just plug this tender in and forget it.', ' Keeps my battery charged between uses. I installed the quick connect cable, it makes it very convenient to hook up and disconnect.', ' I have 3 of these now. I keep all of my batteries connected. My last quad battery lasted almost 8 years', ' Works perfectly fine.

Much more power than cordless vacs, and no recharging needed, but you do have to allow for the cord. No problem for me. The power brush is a terrific feature, works very well, as does the detachable hose which connects to standard vac accessories from our main full-size Kenmore vacuum. You can see the dirt accumulation in the transparent container, and it\\\\s very easy to clean. We\\\\ve had this vac for several years and I\\\\d highly recommend it.', ' I live in a 450 sq ft apartment that has wood floors so the only vacuum I have has been just something for that. Bought this little vacuum because I needed something with a hose to help with all the dust and cat hair I get. For the cost its not a bad little vacuum. I also bought the micro attachments and those are really great. I would recommend getting them even if you dont buy the EasyClean vacuum. If you\\\\re having to vacuum a lot then yes the container might be too small. It is loud, but powerful for its size. If you want something super quiet you\\\\re going to have to pay a lot more. I kept previous attachments from another vacuum I had to throw away. They fit on this hose because of an another attachment from the mirco set you can buy. I even have a little powerpaw attachment for stairs and upholstery, and it still works great power wise so color me impressed. A little heavy but not really a big deal for me. Again though if you want something that is powerful and lightweight (as well as quiet) then you\\\\re gonna have to spend a pretty penny. But the easyclean is much cheaper.', ' I bought this to replace a dirt devil-style hand vacuum. This is only a bit heavier, but the rotating brush makes it much more effective than a hand vacuum that only has suction. I\\\\m using it on a small, low-pile area rug in my room because I don\\\\t have room to store a larger vacuum cleaner. It works like a charm! It also doesn\\\\t have the issues I\\\\ve had with battery-powered hand vacuums in the past that start to lose charge too quickly and become less powerful before I\\\\ve finished the job as the battery ages. The cord is sufficiently long for my small room, but if I were to vacuum a staircase, it wouldn\\\\t be much trouble to use an extension cord. (I\\\\m not sure why I was so prejudiced against corded hand vacuums in the past.) The cord wraps neatly around the base of the vacuum for storage, so without a separate battery-charging dock or power adapter, it\\\\s actually more compact and easier to store than my previous hand vacuums.', ' First, this little baby vacuums like no other. I use it to clean up after doing woodwork with my Dremel. It has great suction. It\\\\s a convenient size to tote around/ You can use either the hose or the floor base. The only negative point is that the filter bag seems to have limited capacity. I have to change/clean it more often than I would ideally want. But the trade off in terms of efficiency is worth it to me. Just saying, that\\\\s a factor you might take into account.', ' Oh my goodness this is a great little vacuum. Since it\\\\s a plug in, the power and suction is amazing. Be sure to keep the filter cleaned after use so the suction doesn\\\\t go away. Like the cup that\\\\s easy to empty. The features are great. I\\\\d like this in a little bigger size. Comes in so handy and I use it to clean my car and the little crumbs I find on my carpet after snack time. Very happy with this product.', ' So happy I made this purchase. I\\\\ve purchased a few attachments for my vacuum to do my carpeted stairs but as soon as I would start using it the suction was lost and the beater bar would no longer turn. This hand held corded vacuum is amazing. I use it for a lot of things, vacuuming animal hair off of my couch! awesome suction, i love that it is corded so I don\\\\t have to worry about a battery dying.', ' I like it a great deal. It is a bit heavy, but that\\\\s ok since it must have more metal parts that won\\\\t break soon, like plastic. It did a good job cleaning the dog hair from the furniture. The head doesn\\\\t clean as closely to the edges so I used the hose to get the corners and edges on the carpeted staircase. It has good suction and cleaning. Love the swivel brush cover for angles.', ' Absolutely love this hand-held vacuum! Overrun with fur from two sweet golden retrievers and a cat I needed something powerful but small enough to keep plugged in and hidden for quick clean up jobs. The Riser Visor makes vacuuming vertical surfaces a breeze! I was skeptical of the negative reviews regarding the weight of the vacuum - I haven\\\\t found that to be a problem.', ' We have 2 big dogs and a cat. This thing removes pet fur like I have never seen! Wow! It has some quirks though: super loud, makes a funky sqeaky noise, and the hose it waaaay too short, but stores easily. For the price it is a really good product. I lent it to a co-worker, and she still talks about what a great job it did de-fuzzing her furniture.', ' This is a great little vacuum useful for stairs, small areas and cleaning up around the house. It works well on carpet. We use the hose to clean out drawers and areas that we used to use a dust buster for. Having a power cord means no charging or dead batteries. This vacuum has a lot of suction power. I would definitely recommend.', ' Okay this vacuum is absolutely great. However, after 2.5 years it has already had motor problems so I will probably need to replace it. I am thinking about maybe buying it again or trying another one. As long as it doesn\\\\t conk out on you too soon, it is a great vacuum for cars, stairs, and furniture.', ' great little handheld vacuum! this little guy has quite a bit of power! it is perfect for my carpeted stairs and all those places it\\\\s difficult for a normal vacuum to work. Cleans up hair from all 3 of my animals without a problem. By far the best little vacuum I\\\\ve ever had!', ' Works okay. Pretty good suction, but the brush/beater bar is powered by the same suction. It stops spinning very easily. Doesn\\\\t spin most of the time. Only spins with light pressure being used. I would recommend looking for one that uses the electric motor to spin the brush.', ' After 2 other handheld Vacuums which were not effective and one died after 1 use. The Eureka vacuum is excellent! Nice long cord which allows me to vacuum my entire stairway. Easy to attach and clean. Highly recommend this item.', ' This is a solid, powerful vacuum. The filter is heavy-duty and seems very durable. It\\\\s easily removed and reattached. I use those over-priced compressed air duster cans to blow all the dust and dog hair off of the filter.', ' This is a solid, powerful vacuum. The filter is heavy-duty and seems very durable. It\\\\s easily removed and reattached. I use those over-priced compressed air duster cans to blow all the dust and dog hair off of the filter.', ' GOT MINE IN 2012 AND STILL USE IT TODAY. PROBABLY THE BEST BUY FOR A SMALL CORDED VAC YOU\\\\LL FIND. POWERFUL, COMPACT, AND UGLY ENOUGH THAT NOBODY WILL STEAL IT. GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.', ' This is a good item and I like the color of this vacuum cleaner. I am happy with this purchase and I am glad. The moment I received them, I already tried them and I know that it works!', ' I LOVE this little guy. Cleans up the cat fur off our microfiber couches so easily. I find myself using it so much more than I expected to because it\\\\s so easy to grab it and clean!', ' This is my second one in 6 months. Worked awesome in the time I had it. Used it everyday. Have 2 dogs. Hope this one last longer. Otherwise will go with a different brand.', ' Works great, but loud', ' This thing can take a little bit of elbow work to use occasionally, depending on how much space you\\\\re vacuuming, but it has great power behind it and works well!', ' Much more powerful than a cordless. Does a good job. A little heavy, but this is the trade off for more power. Long cord is handy. Great for pet hair.', ' Great for stairs and furniture. Switchable to clean horizontal and vertical surfaces. Easy to clean. Incredibly handy with a LONG cord too.', ' LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Exactly what I was looking for to clean my stairs and little messes made by my children. Awesome product.', ' We use this vacuum every week to clean our stairs. So less cumbersome than a full size vacuum and makes it a lot quicker.', ' I\\\\ve never been very impressed with hand vacs but this little thing pulls some real suction. It does a great job!', ' It works great for the stairs and for the car. Better suction than my shark! I\\\\ve recommended it to many people.', ' A bit noisy but quite powerful AND not bulk. I bought several of them for my family members. They all love it.', ' Works great on pet hair. It has the power brush, and the corded motor produces a good bit of suction ..', ' This is a great product. Light weight with lots of suction make this an excellent choice.', ' A small vacuum, but is very powerful. Allows for reach at ceiling and floor corners.', ' Powerful sucking power. Blows air out the back, however, which blows my pile around.', ' So far, a great vacuum for quick cleanups around the house and for carpeted stairs.', ' Thing is a beast. Don\\\\t mind having to empty it out as much as I thought I would.', ' This thing is alright. It works as advertised but is kind of bulky.', ' it removes cat hair so well, it is very powerful and easy to use ..', ' Awesome little vacuum, works better than my Kirby on the stairs!', ' Great little stair vacuum! Even does the front of the stairs!', ' LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. Great suction, easy to clean.', ' Great for cleaning Cat hair of the furniture.', ' Works amazing. So much power. Does the job', ' My camper vacumm, does the job ver well.', ' A tad heavy but all in all great buy.', ' would buy again great product ..', ' Better than the Oreck hand held.', ' Extremely heavy and cumbersome', ' Works great. Glad I bought it.', ' given as a gift, works fine', ' Man this thing is powerful!', ' Great little cleaner!!!', ' works very well', ' I\\\\d orchestrated to get the diminutive Dyson, but the reviews of this vacuum persuaded me to give it an endeavor. It\\\\s absolutely excellent. It\\\\s the best handheld vacuum I\\\\ve ever endeavored, and I\\\\ve thrown more of these things away than I can recollect. Fortuitously, I\\\\ve always preserved the affixes. Sometimes they fit another model, sometimes they don\\\\t. Since there\\\\s no fancy coupling required to annex implements to the hose terminus of this one, it\\\\s just friction, most felt it.', ' I have been struggling to find a vacuum for my stairs to get all the dirt and cat hair up and this does the job with no problem', ' I would not have heated animal dishes without this! Saves energy and your time while providing warm food or water to your animals, or for those vehicles that need to be plugged in during the winter and you did not want to go out in the cold to plug them in. This turns the electricity on or off within various temperatures to anything plugged in so you do not have to remember to plug or unplug something constantly.', ' Thrilled with the ease of this! I plugged this into the heater in my chicken coop for the cold weather (cause I just can\\\\t stand the idea of my little girls freezing their feathers off!) and as promised it kicks on at 35 and right off again at 45. I couldn\\\\t be happier and recommend it for anyone who has pets they worry about in colder weather!', ' It does do what it says however, when I tried to disconnect it from my power cord and this was its first use, the ground terminal was so tight it broke off! I am buying a new one but this was very disappointing and I can\\\\t tell whether the fault was the power cord or the device. Certainly, something I\\\\m going to beware of second time around...', ' Purchased to plug in an electric heater for the bath room in my barn. This way i was not relying on the thermostat inside the heater - which have been known to not last very long. I like the 35-45 temp range. Checked last night (1/21/16) when the outside temp was about 11 degrees F, the bathroom was sufficiently warm. So far so good.', ' I love this! I could never find anything that would allow me to plug my laptop charger in. The charger is very wide and would cover the other outllet. I love this because I can actually use both sockets', ' This little thermoelectric device is great! I use it for my block heater and oil pan heater. It turns on when the temperature drops below 35F. It turns off when the temperature rises to 45F.', ' Works fine, but fit & finish are lacking. Blades for plugging in and ground prong not parallel and loose. You probably can\\\\t plug and unplug unit too often, better to leave plugged in IMHO.', ' Using this in our pump house with a heat bulb - and have one in our chicken house with a heated water bowl - saves energy - work great', ' I\\\\m glad I decided to buy this to regulate my water heater base for my chickens water. So far it works great!', ' It allows the heater to run but not long enough to keep the cats\\\\ water bowl from freezing.', ' This worked just as described. cycles on and off with the temp and saves on some power!', ' Bought this to use with the K & H Heated Kitty House. Works great!', ' Works as advertised. Used for heating a well house. OK so far.', ' I am very satisfied . I think it is energy efficient ?', ' Very nice addition for a wellhouse heater.', ' Smooth quick deal, works great.

Have not asked how it works.', ' Ok', ' This net is great for storing your little ones toys! its very easy to set up and use. the net is very stretchy so you can fit a large amount of toys in them. my son has so many stuffed animals so this was the ideal storage solution for me. i also purchased another one for my garage i use that one to store sports equipment such as balls and gloves. so this product is a great multi use storage solution', ' Wonderful for the price. I almost got the more expensive hammock. I am so glad I didnt. Its very big and sturdy. It was easy to hang...just tap the wall to listen for a stud. You could use 3m hooks if you dont want to put hooks in your walls. We hung our lower so my son could reach his animals. He plays with them a LOT!!!', ' Love this! It was just big enough to fit all of my son\\\\s stuffed animals into. It hangs nicely above his bed. Came with three screws that were easy to install into the wall and has not fallen once. Great buy for kids with stuffed animals!', ' It\\\\s a great product for my daughter room; I\\\\m happy with this purchase. I was able to even fit some big teddy bears in there without it falling down, hold up well. It better the the long tube I purchase from IKEA.', ' About 2 years after buying it.... it\\\\s still in the same place I originally hung it. Nothing broke, nothing fell, and it still looks great. Very happy with this.', ' not all that good. I was not that big. I was not able to hang it up without it falling down since my home is a mobile home only the walls are not sturdy.', ' this is actually much bigger than I thought it was, which works out good because it fit even more stuffed animals than I thought it would!', ' Great value for the money - hanging in my son\\\\s room for months with at least 3 dozen large and small stuffed animals.', ' This is a large net and holds well over 30 stuffed animals in it of various sizes.', ' Can fit so much if you take the time and organize. Great for stuffed animals.', ' Good for storing all the stuff cluttering things up.', ' Exactly What Was Expected!', ' works perfect as described', ' Great', ' i shaved with another brand shaving cream (out of a toothpaste type container), and felt like the blade was grabbing at my whiskers. using this product, (i apply with badger shaving brush) and same blade, it feels like a totally different blade, smooth and comfrotable shave. for next purchase, i plan to try another brand of similar shaving cream, this one has a fragrance that is not my favorite.', ' This is just an all around great shave cream! Easy to load the brush (doesn\\\\t require much cream either) easy to attain a thick, rich lubricating lather, even when I just do a face brush lather. The scent is wonderful. Not too strong, not too weak...I\\\\d say it\\\\s just right. It leaves your facial skin nice and smooth, ready for whatever after shave regime you choose.', ' Really good stuff! Not quite as good as wool fat but it\\\\s great when I want a shave without the time spent on whipping up a lather with soap. This shaving cream makes a nice lather that stays for the duration of the shave.', ' This is some of the best shaving cream out there and the smell of sandalwood is awesome! I use this in conjunction with a double edge safety razor and badger brush to get a close shave and also keep costs down.', ' My husband smells really good after using this, and he says the lack of alcohol in the cream is nicer to the skin. Also, whipping it up with a brush looks badass.', ' Lady here: this stuff lathers really nicely, it\\\\s kind to my extremely sensitive skin, it\\\\s SLS free, and it smells awesome! Best shaving cream I\\\\ve ever used.', ' Like to shave, do you enjoy the art of the straight razor or any derivation of it? this is age old, time tested and approved,....good stuff.', ' Have bought this product a few times and wouldn\\\\t consider using a different one. The smell is wonderful and it gives a wonderful shave.', ' Nice leather, nice smell. My Merkur razer glides across my face. I will buy again in a few months when it runs out.', ' Bought this gem for my husband, and I am very much enjoying his sweet, shaved face, that smells so very masculine.', ' Use this every day. Will continue to use these creams. Lather not as thick as I would like, but finish is great.', ' One of the best shaving creams out there. Combine this with a good badger brush and it will produce a very nice lather that provides a great shave with little irritation. Sandalwood is a great scent. I believe this cream to be slightly better than the Art of Shaving. Remember, a lot goes a long way with real shaving cream. I recommend anyone to leave the aresol based shaving creams in the cans and start using real cream with a badger brush. It will turn a chore into a labor of love.', ' What can I say that hasn\\\\t already been repeated dozens of times? TOBS is pretty much the standard all other creams are judged by. Smells great, lathers easily and bountifully, gives superb protection and glide, rinses cleanly and easily and the scent has some legs. The Cremo Cream rocked my world when I discovered it a while back. After my second shave with this stuff....I gave away my stockpile of Cremo.', ' SMELLS SO GOOD. Seriously, when my man shaves with this you can tell. His face is smooth and this scent is absolutely divine.', ' Love the scent and lathering. The best', ' I love Taylor of old bond shaving cream for sensitive skin.. Hands down the best shaving cream I\\\\ve used and it smells very good also.

He loves it and every time he uses, I obsessively smell his face. He says that he doesn\\\\t need to use much for appropriate coverage and he likes the way it feels.', ' Great scent. Good consistency. Product was as expected. Put a dollop in my mug and gave it a few whisks with the badger brush for some fun face lather. When this bowl runs out, I\\\\ll buy another. :)', ' Its hard for me to justify spending that much on shaving cream, but my wife loves the old fashioned smell. Reminds you of an old barbershop. Its works really well. A little goes a long way.', ' This was my 3rd order of this shaving cream. I\\\\m hooked! Reminds me of being in an old fashioned barbershop as a kid. Getting a shave before I really even needed one. Great smell!!', ' I was using other shave soaps but really like this shaving cream more. The smell is nice too, but not overbearing.', ' ð???ð??»ð???ð??»ð???ð??»', ' Great prod', ' This stuff smells great and helps maintain a smooth shave with a safety razor.', ' very good shave cream, good price!', ' I won\\\\t use anything else.', ' Works and smells great!', ' Smells Like Lysol....YUCK! This foams up beautifully, however, it STINKS!', ' nothing fancy...but works great for a beginners metal detector. My son loves it. We\\\\ve already found a few bullets and other odd metal items. Can\\\\t beat the price for this item and it is easy to use. therefore I give it five stars.', ' Great item at a great price! My 7 year old boy got this from Santa! It is easy to use and fits perfectly for him! As he grows, we can adjust it and I love that! We\\\\ve had a lot of fun with it finding all kinds of neat things!!', ' My son was so happy to receive this (he\\\\s 6). It\\\\s too cold right now, but he has been going around the house with it. Picks up nails on the floor. Can\\\\t wait to see how it works outside once the snow melts.', ' my son and nephew had a lot of fun searching for nails in my brother-in-laws work yard! We haven\\\\t tried it in sand yet. Very good product for the price.', ' this is the one gift my grandson really wanted he has not used it much because of snow and cold. but seems easy to use and he cant wait.', ' Wasn\\\\t so impressed... might be a fun gift for your kids.', ' Granddaughter was very happy!', ' Just right for my 7 year old.', ' Very nice for 11 year old', ' I had bought one of the little handheld spiralizers and quickly realized I needed something easier. I got this to make zucchini spaghetti, but have also used it for scalloped potatoes, carrot/cucumber Vietnamese style salads and more. Great addition to my kitchen. Cleaning is easy, but I do find the different blade options hard to pull out sometimes... I\\\\m sure I am missing some key leverage point....', ' Great product. Only giving it 4 stars because it is awkward to use if you are left handed.', ' After placing my order, I had mixed feelings about this product. Some reviewers stated that the original Paderno spiralizer was easier to use, but I am glad I decided to give this one a try. The blades can be changed easily without risk of cutting yourself and it all stores back nicely. As long as the unit grips to the surface, one should not have to use a lot of force to spiral fruits/vegetables manually. I love using squash and zucchini to replace pasta and other solid fruits are also easy to use. You must try the baked apple crisps recipe!', ' I love this product so much, I\\\\ve used it practically every day since it has arrived! The plastic is easy to clean - just rinse with hot and cold water as soon as you\\\\re finished spiralizing. I\\\\ve made zoodles (zucchini noodles) and swoodles (sweet potato noodles) and I absolutely love them. This spiralizer is an essential kitchen tool for every plant based eater. One thing is, you have to get used to pressing towards the blade whilst turning the spiralizer handle at the same time. I highly recommend this product.', ' Love this spiralizer. Bought one for myself, and then one for my best friend, and then my sister, and then another one for me to keep at my parents\\\\ house. It makes quick work of slicing for cucumber salad, potatoes au gratin, onions (for anyone lacking knife skills), and veggie packets for the grill. And the entire thing is dishwasher safe. What could be better?', ' *LOVE* I am now completely obsessed with this machine. Highly recommend this along with the two cookbook deal, Inspiralized and The Skinnytaste Cookbook.', ' Great product but a little delicate . stainless would be more durable but of course more expensive', ' I was disappointed that I couldn\\\\t do raw beets, carrots, parsnips, etc., with this spiralizer. I had envisioned beautiful multicolored spiralized salads, etc. The picture certainly shows carrots and beets, but they were just too dense for this appliance, as the recipe book that I purchased to go with it stated. That book suggested a Vegetti spiralizer for those denser vegetables. In addition, the Padrerno wouldn\\\\t stay clamped on my countertop (granite) and it kept moving as I tried to use it. It worked great with zucchini (fexcept for having to chase it down the counter) but I couldn\\\\t see any point in keeping it just for zucchini. I returned it.', ' The Paderno World Cuisine Tri-Blade is as reviewed. I scoured multiple reviews to find the best spiralizer and have not been disappointed. Many people liked this one better than the 4 blade system so I decided to get this one instead of the 4 blade. The amount of vegetable left on the spiralizer after using it is very minimal and it is quick to use. It attaches in a sturdy fashion with the suction cup feet.', ' This is really awesome! It makes making zoodles or any other type of vegetable noodles really easy, I got the package that includes four razor blades, and it\\\\s definitely worth it, each different razor allows you to make different sized zoodles, and I\\\\m sure each one will come in handy at one point or another. If you\\\\re on a paleo diet, this is a must have, it makes eating vegetables a lot more enjoyable.', ' ONLY reason i\\\\m not giving this 5 stars is because I ordered the 4 blade model and though it came with 4 blades, two are identical. In the picture, i have two of the large spiral blades on the right. I believe i am missing one of the two in the middle (the one on the left looks like one i have) but i\\\\m not sure which. I\\\\ll update my review to 5 stars if the seller/manufacturer swaps out my blade.', ' It works fairly well but there was NO recipe book as expected--so I don\\\\t know what that is about. I have to believe that the flimsy plastic construction will not last if it is used routinely. Basically it is a cheap, fad, food prep item and if it helps us utilize our garden zucchini it will be worth the small expense next summer , until it breaks:-)', ' Easy to operate with very little exertion required. Makes great zucchini spaghetti! First time I made it I mixed it with pasta spaghetti and my husband didn\\\\t even know half was zucchini! The blades are easy to change, its easy to clean and the suction cups hold it firm to the counter (we have smooth granite countertops which probably helps).', ' I love it. It makes cooking so much fun.', ' I bought this in hopes of being able to spiral carrots, but the are just too skinny. Zucchini works great. I love zucchini noodles. Looking forward to trying sweet potatoes sometime soon! This product is easy to take apart and clean. It\\\\s compact too so it fits nicely in the cupboards when not in use.', ' The three blades are nice and they tuck under the product for storage so they won\\\\t get lost. The product is easy to use and all dishwasher safe which is nice. I haven\\\\t used it a lot to know how well the blades hold their sharpness, but so far, I really like this product.', ' This makes perfect spiral veggies and fun to use. It also is easy to store because of the way it fits so compact into itself. We did not have small children around but I am sure you could find some fun ways to get you little ones to eat their veggies with this unit....', ' Just love this gadget. I have made some very healthy salads out of raw beets, sweet potatoes and probably any other fresh vegetable. I have also used this to use zucchini instead of pasta for tomatoe sauce. Very tasty. Even better than pasta. Easy to clean.', ' This thing is amazing. I had the little hand held one and it just took FOREVER, and my hand always cramped up, got cut, and turned the color of whatever I was making. This is SO FAST and easy. Easy to clean also, and really doesn\\\\t take up too much room.', ' I\\\\ve been experimenting on fresh salads lately and I felt that I needed something fancy to attract the kids to the type of food I prepare them. This was a lifesaver. A little change in the shape and they\\\\ve taken interest already.', ' It does what its supposed to do for most part, u end up with half noodles half slices. But depends on veggie, its kind of pain to take apart put together and clean. But it is much better than the hand held cheap ones', ' From a person who does not like kitchen gadgets because they waste space and sit somewhere collecting dust, this product is just okay. It has a layer of dust on it in my pantry. It is just so much to clean up!', ' This is very well made, easy to assemble and disassemble. Makes cooking fun. Have used it with carrots, hard winter squashes( peel before hand , zucchini, potatoes, beets, etc. Very happy with the purchase.', ' Neat device! I look forward to using it more when zucchinis are in season to make zucchini pasta. After a full season of use, I might give it another star if it delivers as hoped.', ' Love it. Super easy to clean and use. If your deciding between the 3 and 4 blade; 3 blade pretty much covers everything. I am new to veggie noodles but so far so good!', ' Great product-- love!', ' Love this thing! It works perfectly. Very easy to set up, use and clean. It takes me five minutes to make a huge bowl of zoodles. Game changer! Highly recommend.', ' I love this product. It is so easy and quick to use and produces great results. I ended up buying several for family and recommend it to friends all the time!', ' It did not come with all parts that it shows on package and states in the instruction booklet. It lists wooden skewers and it did not come with them.', ' Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. He uses it all the time. It is so easy to use and works fast! Easy clean up too.', ' Works just like it\\\\s supposed to! Easy to use and clean up...takes up very little space on the counter! I will use it often', ' Amazing kitchen tool, love making my pasta salads with this! So fun, my children love to help with this too.', ' great item, works better than others costing lots more, easy to clean, fun to use bought one or my daughter too', ' Love this for making noodles from squash and zucchini, and curly fries from sweet potatoes! Pretty easy cleanup.', ' Great alternative for the all time favorite yet rich in calorie snack, pasta. Water melon pasta is the BEST!!!', ' doesn\\\\t really cut everything to cook. cuts your vegetables more for a nice presentation ...', ' Works wonderfully. Clean up is easy and it\\\\s incredibly easy to operate and clean up.', ' I bought it to curl potatoes and the result was excellent! Itâ??s fun to eat now.', ' Awesome makes veggies look like spaghetti. Best one I ever bought', ' Gave as gifts and they liked it very much. Use every day.', ' worked great!! make sure to wash it right away though.', ' This is so easy to use and clean. So fast. Love it.', ' very fast and does just what it says', ' Great product, great transaction.', ' Easy to assemble easy to use.', ' It slices and dices!', ' Convenient to use!', ' Simply the best!', ' I love it .', ' I would of given this five stars but honestly the directions that come with this suck. I had to look online to figure it out. Other then that this product is awesome!!! I\\\\m a pasta addict and this has changed my life. I love how this version is so organized and the angel hair blade a must.', ' Swirly!', ' makes veggies cool again...', ' Okay, I gave this as a gift last year, and I love it, however, I bought myself a cheap knockoff of a Vegetti, and it does the job just fine, but I couldn\\\\t give a gourmand a cheap knockoff without looking cheap, which I am, but still....', ' it was a gift', ' wonderful!', ' Firstly, I was absolutely delighted that it came in two days earlier than the estimated delivery date. I eagerly took it out to immediately use it on my first ever car (a used 2008 smart passion cabrio) that I had just gotten December 28th. The back-lit numbers showed up within a second of application, if not less than that. I managed to find out that every single one of my tires were so severely different in pressure from one another that it was beyond ridiculous. Everything between being under inflated, to OVER-inflated. I highly recommend it for anyone not just wanting to save in gas usage, but also for an improved driving performance, prolonged lifespan of every tire, and the comfort of a smooth drive.', ' Dead on tire PSI match for my Milton S921 Pencil Type Tire Gauge. Only reason I bought the Accutire is because it\\\\s hard for me to see small print unless I am using reading glasses. I can see the Accutire without reading glasses. This one uses batteries, so eventually it is not going to work. The made in USA Milton S921 is really good for car tires in the range of 5 to 50 PSI, and it will work for a long time because it does not need batteries, but if you have old eyes like me you will need a pair of reading glasses, or be in bright sunlight. The Accutire is just more convenient to use, but if my eyes were good as they use to be the Milton would be my first choice.', ' I use this gauge in my car all the time I need to check my car\\\\s tyre pressure. it is easy to use and there is light when displaying . I am happy to have a small and great device like this. when you using it, don\\\\t allow air to leak out while measuring the tyre pressure, this happens for a moment and you should centre it to get a correct result. this gauge keep the result on the screen for a while after measuring. you can check the pressure again and again. when you get the same results it means you get the correct result.', ' Bought this pressure gauge to keep in my car. Works like a charm and is super easy to use! I love the digital display and how fast it displays the tire pressure. Great accessory to have in anyone\\\\s car. If you are thinking about buying this, you will not be disappointing. It is worth the price, and honestly isn\\\\t even that expensive.', ' I\\\\ve had this gauge for many years and love it. Battery seems to outlast the life of the unit. This is the second one I purchased and have no problem recommending this.', ' Simple and easy read out. Seems to be accurate, I haven\\\\t tested against other models but my tire sensors have not gone off when filling tires to recommended PSI.', ' A little different from a previous one I had, but once I did it correctly it was perfect. Easy to hold and get onto the valve securely.', ' Works great, and I have no problems with it yet. After using it more, I will change to a 5 star review.', ' easy to see even in sun and always visible at night. Accuracy is high,', ' Works accurately. Holds the reading long enough to be logged.', ' Accurite has a good reputation and this tool lives up to it.', ' I love it .. it has been more than one year .. works great..', ' This is the best thing ever and it\\\\s super easy to use.', ' Works great!

However, this product was everything I needed. Most of the downside complaints were directed toward preparing the product either cold or in coffee, etc. I decided to used very warm broth, stir the product in and drink. Great Lakes dissolved perfectly, drank it down. No grainy taste, no after taste.', ' This gelatin has helped my varicose veins which I developed when pregnant. I was in so much pain, my veins would throb and itch, but once I started drinking this in my tea everyday, the pain and itching is gone and the vericose veins aren\\\\t swollen anymore and their appearance is less noticeable. I love this gelatin! It\\\\s high quality and the only one I will buy.', ' Is use the green can as a supplement and this red can to make things like jello jiggers.

No discernible flavor. I dissolve about a tsp. of gelatin and a tsp of sugar in half a mug of water each morning, let it bloom, zap it for half a minute, and just drink it with my breakfast. Fingernails are now nice and hard and longer than they\\\\ve been since I was young. Also great for cooking!', ' This is a perfect product when one needs to add gelatin to a recipe.

My joints are better. I use both this one and the green one interchangeably.

This wax substance works much like gel except that it is not shiny and has a matte like finish. This allows it to give your hair a more natural texture and appearance. It is also not brittle like gel is, so you can still run your hands through it and it will hold your hair up. The normal size container lasts me probably 8 months or some thing (ballpark) with regular length guy hair (though I suppose my girlfriend uses it on occasion now that I think about it), but it does eventually start drying up even if you just open it to get it on your finger and then close it.

About 20 minutes after a shower with my hair and I just run my hand through my hair for like 2 seconds and it looks great.', ' I have been using American Crew Fiber for my hair for over a year and really like it. I have average guy hair, as my wife calls it. Short in the back and sides and a little longer and messy up top. This stuff is nice, keeps my hair in place and isn\\\\t too greasy or stiff. The people who cut my hair always ask me if I wear Fiber, so must be something that is used a lot.', ' This stuff makes my hair look awesome simply put, it can be hard and sometimes slightly painful to work through your hair if its dry, but with a little water and some time, this is the only stuff that holds my hair without making it look super shiny or over-produced.', ' I\\\\ve been using Crew Fiber for several years now after having been a loyal pink Gatsby Wax fan. Fiber is great because it isn\\\\t difficult to wash out and is flexible enough that you can tweak your style throughout the day. It gives off a nice natural look.', ' Well made product.

TIGI bed head matte separation wax) but gives your hair a nice natural look that can be used every day', ' Great product. This is the best hair product I\\\\ve used.

This is my go-to product, when milk in my right breast starts dwindling...but be ready to get more milk in both breasts. So far I have never needed to resort to formula milk, for any of my 3 kids, thanks to Fenegreek.', ' I bought this supplement in hopes of increasing my supply. While some women stated that it worked for them just after taking it a few days, that wasn\\\\t the case for me. After taking it for about 2 days, my son became very gassy.

It\\\\s not like your getting engorged or anything. If anything your breast feel like they are producing milk faster. At the end of the day I don\\\\t feel empty and it doesn\\\\t take 5 minutes for let down to start. So I say it\\\\s gotta be helping. I use 2 tea bags in 1 8oz drink with a little creamer twice a day. I don\\\\t feel it has a bad taste like some others reviews. Well not if u add a flavored creamer.', ' I love this tea!! I\\\\m Indian, so that fennel licorice flavor doesn\\\\t bother me at all because we use these spices in our cooking. Anyway, I am 10 weeks postpartum and going to back. I\\\\ve been pumping since the beginning but on average I only pump about 3 ounces every time I pump. I\\\\ve had to drop down my number of pumping sessions to be able to work it into my work schedule. I\\\\ve been trying to extend the amount of time I\\\\m pumping when I\\\\m at home, but I still only was getting around 3 ounces. My son has a healthy appetite!! I was struggling to keep up. I started taking fenugreek capsules and it boosted it a little, but not by much. I got this tea and by the second day I was up to 4 ounces, and a day after that, I\\\\m now at 5 ounces per session. That\\\\s a big improvement to me! I\\\\m drinking 4 cups daily (recommended 3-5 cups a day). I like the flavor of the tea and it helps me get extra fluids in!

I ordered a second filter directly from Honeywell, due to the complaints on Amazon, and it was white -without the blue prefilter outer layer. So I promptly emailed Honeywell and was given the courtesy of a quick response. They told me that Honeywell no longer makes the filters with the blue outer layer. The white layer is supposed to give more humidity. I have found this to be true, however, the blue outer filter really filtered out more small particles from the air. We have multiple pets so this was an important feature for us. Also some people are having a bacteria/mold issue. 4 drops of tea tree oil in each water tank nightly will eliminate any problem. Begin with a clean tank, of course. Another thing I do is flip the filter nightly so all of the mineralization does not end up in one spot and clog the filter. One last maintainence trick - as another reviewer said - wash the base with white vinegar on a regular basis and let your filter soak in a vinegar water bath to remove the minerals. Last year I only needed two filters for 6 months of use. Cannot say about the all white filters -will update at end of season. I do think the filter price is quite a bit too high for what you get now. Still love my Honeywell humidifier!', ' the second time i get this from amazon, always good quality but i feel little bit high the price. but still love this.', ' Exactly what i expected.

I have issues with my teeth. A couple are chipped. And I tend to get infections no matter how much I floss. Once, I changed to an electric Oral B toothbrush using the Floss Action heads, my problems with infections ended. Plus, I\\\\m a heavy cigar smoker and no matter what I used to whiten my teeth, nothing really worked. Using a whitening tooth paste and this combo of electric toothbrush and head has lightened my teeth by at least 5 shades. My teeth now look normal and not like someone who sells moon shine in the hills of Appalachia. And I just purchased the Oral B Pro White head to heighten the whitening process. Great product and the price is right on the money.', ' I think this brush head is my favorite out of all I have purchased for my toothbrush and I have them all.

Ordered a second one for my wife\\\\s car, after (you guessed it) the ice scraper on her\\\\s disintegrated.', ' This is as good a brush/scraper as I\\\\ve ever encountered. My only qualm is that the foam grip is too far from the scraper end to use for leverage when doing heavy-duty ice scraping. In the picture, the grip is where it is supposed to be, but mine is closer to the brush than the scraper and I can\\\\t seem to budge it.', ' Just received my brush today in a red color. It feels very sturdy, not cheap plastic. The foam grip feels nice as well and not of a cheap crumbly material. The brush is heavy duty and bristles are secure and not falling out or frayed.', ' This device comes in handy. It\\\\s not too big and not too small.

It\\\\s been used multiple times a week since. For the price, this is a great steamer. Safe and more effective than ironing multiple times a week! Looking back I have no idea how I went without a steamer. Never wearing wrinkly clothes is awesome! The heat up is fast, faster than my Jiffy J-2000, which is a much more expensive steamer. The unit, for the price, is built fine. The telescopic pole is a little flimsy and a little too short in my opinion, but the hook provided to hang your garment on is easy to use. I also like the hook to hang the hose on when not in use. I prefer these hooks over my Jiffy J-2000. The included attachments make steaming easier provided you\\\\re using them for their intended purpose. Most modern steamers include castors which is a convenient. This unit should include some locking castors for use on hard smooth flooring. Onto maintenance issues...this unit WILL clog eventually if you use tap water. Do not use tap water, use de-mineralized water with any steamer. It is a pain to have to clean out a steamer when it could have been prevented. I did not listen to this advice in any manual I have read about steamers and today I cleaned out 3 years of mineral build up from my Steamfast. I will also be cleaning out my Jiffy J-2000. The Steamfast would produce steam steadily and then about 60 seconds in it would taper off to nothing. Figuring it was clogged I eventually just decided to take it apart today and see if I could clean it myself. No amount of vinegar steaming through this unit would do anything - HOURS of steaming with vinegar. From disassembly to cleaning to reassembly it took about 20 minutes. Easy peasy anyone can do it. Many pipe cleaners later it\\\\s working perfectly again. I included pictures of the before and after. It was disgusting. If you decide to take this unit apart yourself, be careful with the hose it, it could crack and they do not sell this part, they just want to sell you another unit! For the price this unit is absolutely worth it if you intend to take care of it. Steaming is easier, safer, and more efficient than ironing.', ' Love this a lot. Got one for my daughter a few years ago, and it\\\\s been on my to get list. So glad I finally did. I have only two complaints about it, and it\\\\s that the handle isn\\\\t as long as I\\\\d like (to do curtains while hanging), and it\\\\s not very bottom heavy, which would make it a bit sturdier. Other than that, I am sorry I put off buying it. Does a great job, doesn\\\\t take up much space, and heats up quickly.', ' I bought this for my sister she wears business wear to work so I felt this could be of use for her. She loves it and says it so easy to use and store. Plus she has a newborn and a 2 year old so it helps that it\\\\s easy to fit into her schedule.', ' Use distilled water to avoid build up of gunk. Do not use faucet water.', ' I LOVE this steamer! The only thing that would make it better is if the hose reached higher. Great product!', ' Works very well, still trying to perfect my technique though.', ' LOVE IT, its sturdy and works well.', ' Love it for the money', ' So far I have only used this on frost and it is not great for that. I am on the shorter side and drive a minivan. 35 inches is not long enough for me to hold it well and put enough pressure on it to effectively clear the windshield. The construction looks good and the brush should work well.', ' Good Price, worked perfectly. Quality is just as good as a built in aux (given its the same stereo) just can\\\\t turn the volume up on device to max or distortion will occur. Don\\\\t worry though because the volume is still as loud as any other source.', ' If you have an older car like most people, this is great so you can listen to your new tunes. Price is right. Kids have been using them in their cars for awhile with no complaints. My only complaint is that they play the music too loud.', ' My 16 year old daughter\\\\s \\\\98 Honda Civic is now the life of the party.

They work great!', ' Excellent purchase as advertised.', ' Great quality! Doesn\\\\t overheat.', ' As expected, and not too bright!', ' Worked', ' For some reason, I\\\\ve had the hardest time finding windshield wipers that did an effective job on my \\\\06 Toyota Tacoma. There was always water left behind. I tried a couple different brands, bought a labor-intensive (and expensive) windshield cleaning kit, even had my mechanic check the wipers. Results were all just mediocre. Then I tried these Valeo blades, and as suggested by a fellow Amazon reviewer, combined them with\\xa0Rain-X RX11806D Washer Fluid Additive - 16.9 fl. oz.. The results were remarkable! The cleanest, clearest windshields I\\\\ve had in a long, long time! What I love about the Rain-X Washer Fluid Additive is you don\\\\t have to do the whole rub-on-rub-off treatment, which is a pain. Just dump it in your washer fluid reservoir and you\\\\re done! I can\\\\t vouch for the blades by themselves, but as part of a one-two punch with the Rain-X, man, excellent results! I bought a second pair for my other car with equally great results. Highly recommended! Added Note: I saw a fellow reviewer\\\\s comments regarding the wipers working on a Mazda Miata. My other car is an older 93\\\\ Miata, and the 18 version of these blades work very well on it.', ' Worked fine.', ' Works great', ' Fantastic. I have a HUGE Sears battery in my car that I keep stored during the winter. It only gets driven every other week or so in the winter. It\\\\s my garage kept fun car. This really helps maintain the battery and I get strong starts every time. Can\\\\t complain at all. If you\\\\re buying this to charge a dead battery, it won\\\\t do that. These things need a battery that at least has SOME charge on it. However, hook the dead battery up to another battery that isn\\\\t dead and leave it over night. They\\\\ll equilibrate and then this will go ahead and finish off the charge.', ' I decided to go with he California energy compliant model even though I don\\\\t live in California for the more efficient unit. It was actually cheaper with the Amazon coupon but I would have spent a few dollars more for it. The unit also has some extra safety features built into it over the other non complaint model. Worth buying it over the normal model because it is more efficient, has more safety features, newer and updated in my opinion.', ' Works like the older model always has. Weighs about 1/3 what the previous model weighed, it is very light. LED is difficult to see in ambient light. Seems like it should cost considerably less. Happy with it, and it does what I want it to.', ' I like this new style for my motorcycles as it is energy efficient and specifically built for that application of newer style batteries. My older version were not made for the specific type of new batteries now being used on motorcycles and I was concerned they were overcharging them possibly reducing the life of the battery. I will still use the other for a boat battery. I tried still new style over this last summer and it seemed to work better with the new technology. I have since bought a second one for the other bike for storage this winter. If you buy one of these, research each model closely since there are a lot of varieties for specific needs.', ' My mother leaves and goes to Hawaii to get away from our mountain winters. Her car used to sit in her garage and even though myself and others could start and run the engine for a while, after 6 months the battery would die. So when my mom returned from Hawaii she would need to buy a new battery! Now with this Battery Tender at work(and all seems to be working) the battery should be good when she gets back to the mountains(the car is garaged). I\\\\ll do a follow up in April when she returns as that will give enough time to see how well the Tender works', ' These things have been pretty good at keeping cars, four wheelers, etc all juiced up. however the LED light in them gives out after a while, which makes you not know whether or not they are being charged. Hated them a lot more when i was paying 60 bucks for them at the store, but buying them here for this price makes me pretty happy overall.', ' These things are the best! Out of the box you just connect it up to the battery, plug it in and that\\\\s it. It flashes red while charging, then goes (and stays) green. When you want to ride (I got it for the bike) just unplug it and go. Simple, fast, efficient. Never worry about the battery charge again.', ' I can not rate this high enough. I needed this for my motorcycle. I installed the pigtail lead in under ten minutes and everything else is history. These are wonderful for extending the life of a battery for years longer than normally expected. I rated it 5 stars and I\\\\m giving it another five stars here!', ' Purchased 2 for my Winnie Minnie. Slow charging which after my research is the way to go especially with such expensive RV batteries. Have my two 6 volt batteries in series hooked up as well as my chassis battery. Easy to hook up and understand per the simple light status.', ' Bought this for my Harley. Everything works as expected. I will not know how well it maintained my battery until this coming spring but I\\\\m assuming all will be fine. I\\\\ve only had it for part of the off season so I can\\\\t say how long it will last - but so far, so good.', ' Bought one about a year or two ago and it just died..thought my battery was dead as was flashing red green constantly and regrettably changed out the battery thinking that was the problem.

I\\\\m scared to use it with little kids getting into everything.', ' My parents have had a peculator for many years and I loved the coffee it produced but they spent a lot of money on it when they were in Europe. Thankfully I was able to find one on Amazon for a pretty good deal! Keep in mind though, this won\\\\t fix you a cup of espresso with foam and frothiness. This is a simple espresso maker that gives you great coffee in its purest form. With that said I will move on to why this is an amazing product. A friend of mine who is originally from Cuba recommended cafe Bustello (yellow can red writing) that I conveniently found in our local Publix grocery store. Lets just say this stuff is amazing! It comes out dark and just a little bit thicker than regular coffee without any grit to it. We purchased sugar cubes to go into our little espresso cups to ensure the right amount of sugar. It makes just about six cups or espresso so it was perfect for the two of us. I have used regular coffee grounds in it. Just got some whole bean coffee and ground it up really fine in my electric grinder. Tasted great that way too if you are looking for something different. I do recommend washing it after use when it is cooled down. The rubber rind on the bottom side of the top pot does get stained when it sits there on the coffee grounds for too long. And also drying it so it doesn\\\\t dry out the rubber ring or cause rust on the peculator.', ' In my opinion, this pot makes the best tasting coffee of either espresso or regular type, even better than a French press. I got the big pot because it makes 1 large mug of regular coffee, as well as the espresso that it was designed for. I fill the bottom half with water to just below the valve and loose pack the coffee compartment with my favorite blend. A medium grind will do, which makes pre-ground coffee and option when I am too lazy to grind fresh beans. Put it on my stove\\\\s smallest burner under medium heat and wait. 14 minutes later I have a hot 12 oz. cup of coffee in the upper chamber. Yum. The pot is made of heavy duty aluminum and cleans up easily. My only departure from the description given is that I have never had it make coffee for me in 4-5 minutes. It has always taken 14 minutes. Maybe that was a misprint, or a different heating method was used?', ' I grew up using this type espresso maker, so from that perspective: I love it! Unfortunately, the quality of this Bialetti has been a little dissatisfying. I remember these being a nice heavy, well made product, instead this one feels lightweight and the top portion stained immediately after the first use. It produces a great espresso (which is of course dependent on the beans used). I find this technique to be perfect for a quick brew. Personally, I only drink about one cup of coffee a day, but I have found that whatever is left unused since this is a 3-cup (espresso cup), I simply add the remaining to milk and refrigerate during summer months for a nice iced coffee the next day.', ' If you previously owned a Bialetti you\\\\ll be disappointed. I bought this as a replacement for the same model where the handle broke off after years of use. But it\\\\s not the same. It takes 40% longer to make a pot of coffee. Same stove, same burner, same settings. My old pot takes 10 min and my new one takes 14. I likely won\\\\t buy another Bialetti because I don\\\\t believe in businesses that reduce the quality of products.', ' The coffee is great, but the bottom of the handle melted. I have an electric coil stove top so I can\\\\t concentrate the heat to be only directly under the base of the pot, but I do my best to turn the pot in a way that keeps the handle away from direct heat because I have to be able to pick it up! Regardless, the handle shouldn\\\\t be made of an easily melted material.', ' I\\\\ve had this espresso make for over a couple years now. I just want to say it has spoiled me. It takes a little time to make, but it makes the best cup of espresso. I can\\\\t say that enough. In the time I\\\\ve own this pot I\\\\ve bought a couple machines ranging from $200 - $300. Had espresso at starbucks, at work, they have a few different machines that probably cost $20k. Out of them all this little pot still make the richest, full flavored cup I\\\\ve ever had. All those other machines make a light brown, bitter cup. But not this little guy. It just amazes me. If you like, rich, dark, black, espresso this is what you want. Here\\\\s some tips. Grind your own espresso roast beans. I like the Starbucks espresso roasts. I have my own burr grinder (kitchen aid). I have it set to grind it just fine enough that it doesn\\\\t fall through the filter while brewing. It\\\\s setting 7.5, but it will vary on how you\\\\ve adjusted your grinder. And that\\\\s it. The pot does the rest. If you\\\\re making cappuccino have the milk ready, heated and foamed. I use 1/4 cup milk to a shot (2.75oz). As soon as the espresso is done brewing I pour it right into the milk. The longer it\\\\s exposed to air the more bitter it will get. So right into the milk. I\\\\ll post a picture of the shot it pulls next time I make one. The only con is that it takes probably 5-10mins to make. Which is why I tried a couple machines. I figured if a $35 pot can make this good espresso imagine what a $300 machine could do. And they make them so quick. I was so wrong. The machines made this horrible bitter shots, and I kept thinking, there must be something wrong with this thing. I just paid $300 and I\\\\m getting this light brown water (sometimes it would pull a dark shot, but always bitter). Anyway, I\\\\d this guy a shot before spend hundreds of dollars on a machine.', ' I got this espresso maker after looking at a review on YouTube. I unpackaged it and used it while we had company during Christmas and ended up giving it to our daughter because she enjoyed it so much. I guess ai will have to buy another one now. It is great for preparing a regular cup of coffee or stronger espresso. It also is available in different sizes to fit your needs. I got the smaller 4 cup coffee maker.', ' I bought it to replace my 6 cup. I didn\\\\t realize that i had the 6 cup until this one arrived. it is really small. If you have a gas stove, it is so small that you can only have the stove on low which makes making the coffee kind of hard. Don\\\\t love this one, but do love the 6 cup.', ' The coffee funnel was bent and not round at the bottom point? Thank heaven I ordered a replacement funnel and it was round and ok!!! People there is a lot to be said for going to the store and look everything over before you buy, Just a thought!', ' Love it. Perks fast and tastes great. I havent had to replace the screens yet. Just keep washing them out with water. DO NOT PUT IN DISHWASHER! I made the horrible mistake to and hadto buy a new one!! Yes i know i should have read instructions.', ' Awesome Moka pot. I did a lot of research before selecting this pot and I am very happy with my choice. I definitely recommend using fresh ground beans with this pot. It makes a difference. Good construction, easy maintenance, good coffee.', ' With this moka pot, I enjoy a nice cup of coffee every morning. I used to make coffee with a french press. Now I use my french press to froth the milk to obtain some great cappuccino/latte.', ' This coffee maker gave me a couple great years of use. the rubber gasket finally went after 2 years or so, so i\\\\ll have to pick up a new one. but makes half a standard mug of great coffee!', ' I love the coffee pot, and the concept of it! However, it leaks at the lid by the handle, leaving a coffee streak down the back of the coffee pot, and coffee spray/splatters on the stove.', ' Very solid build and its all Italian made. It\\\\s easy to clean as well. Making coffee in it is hard at first but once you find the right setting on your stove it\\\\s all worth it.', ' Works perfectly--like all my smaller Bialetti pots. I was afraid it would take much longer to boil through, and, of course, it takes a little longer, but still works well.', ' A very nice expresso maker. The recipient was full of praise for this item.
